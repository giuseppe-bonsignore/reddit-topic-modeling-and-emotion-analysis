This mirrors fascist tactics where bureaucratic institutions are reshaped to serve the ruling party's agenda rather than functioning independently.\\n\\nElimination of Oversight and Transparency – The article notes that Musk’s team has restricted access to databases without oversight, making it difficult for anyone outside their inner circle to monitor what is happening. A lack of transparency and independent oversight is a key feature of authoritarian regimes, allowing for potential abuses of power.\\n\\nLoyalty Over Meritocracy – The swift removal of career officials, the sidelining of OPM’s chief management officer, and the installation of Musk’s close associates in key positions suggest a shift from a merit-based civil service to a system that prioritizes political loyalty. Fascist movements often dismantle existing bureaucracies and replace them with loyalists to ensure ideological control.\\n\\nDismantling Institutional Safeguards – By restricting access to federal employment data and controlling who can interact with critical government systems, Musk’s team is bypassing long-standing institutional safeguards. This aligns with fascist strategies where independent government agencies are neutralized to prevent them from acting as checks on executive power.\\n\\nCorporate Influence Over the State – The presence of Musk’s former employees and executives from his private companies taking control of federal agencies indicates a fusion of corporate and state power. Historically, fascist regimes have relied on close relationships with business elites to implement their agendas while suppressing democratic institutions.\\n\\nMilitarization of Workplace Culture – The installation of sofa beds for around-the-clock work reflects an extreme work culture that Musk has enforced at his private companies, now being imposed on a government agency. Fascist regimes often glorify a militarized work ethic, emphasizing sacrifice and total devotion to the state or its leaders.\\n\\nPsychological Coercion and Forced Attrition – The memos encouraging federal workers to take buyouts and leave, framed in an unusually casual tone, suggest an effort to pressure employees to quit rather than outright firing them. This kind of coercion aligns with fascist tactics of purging institutions of those who might resist authoritarian changes.\\n\\nTechno-Authoritarianism – The use of technology to centralize control over government functions without oversight mirrors broader concerns about the role of Big Tech in governance. A government where private tech elites exert direct control over federal systems creates a pathway for surveillance, manipulation, and the erosion of democratic accountability.\\n\\nThese elements suggest a shift toward authoritarian governance with fascist tendencies, where democratic institutions are being eroded in favor of centralized, loyalist control backed by corporate power.\", \"No he won't.

Brown**\\n\\n**The Atlantic, January 31 2025**\\n\\nIn the past two weeks, the Trump administration has spent a remarkable amount of time undoing health orders—not just the Biden administration’s rules, but also its own jarring crackdown.\\n\\nOn day two of Donald Trump’s presidency, the White House ordered a freeze on communications from federal health agencies. The government’s medical-research agency, the National Institutes of Health, devolved into chaos; many employees wondered whether they could continue with basic functions of their job, such as attending scientific meetings and reviewing grants. Days later, a new memo clarified that they could continue their work, but not say anything about it to the public.\\n\\nThis week, after the White House budget office released a memo ordering a freeze on trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans, state Medicaid agencies, hospitals, and community centers were unsure if they could continue operating. The administration had said the freeze would not affect Medicaid, but state administrators were locked out of the federal-funding portal. Soon, states regained access, a judge temporarily blocked the order, and the administration rescinded the memo. (Trump’s orders requiring government agencies to eliminate spending on “woke” ideologies remain in effect.)\\n\\nAmid all that scrambling, the administration also ordered a pause on international aid, which led health organizations to stop distributing HIV medications purchased with U.S. funds, only to have the State Department walk back that directive. But even after the reversal, clinics remained closed.\\n\\nIt’s all a lot to follow, to say the least. In some of its endeavors, the Trump administration does appear to have a clear set of goals: to overwhelm the opposition and seize power for the executive branch. But so far, the president’s strategy for restoring America to an imagined healthier version of itself seems to consist of no strategy at all. Previously, Trump had suggested that his policies would be whatever Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, wanted—“I’m going to let him go wild on health,” Trump said at a rally in October. And yet, during his confirmation hearings this week, Kennedy repeatedly deferred to Trump. He elaborated his thoughts on regenerative agriculture (which would not fall under his purview at the Department of Health and Human Services), but when quizzed on hot-button issues such as the abortion drug mifepristone (which would), he parroted the party line. “I will implement President Trump’s policies,” Kennedy said.\\n\\n\\nThe changes that have stuck (so far) are a hodgepodge of policies, and appear more focused on getting rid of ideas and initiatives the president doesn’t like than on fixing the problems of cost and access that pervade America’s health-care ecosystem. Trump issued an executive order requiring that the federal government recognize only two sexes, despite decades of biological research showing that sex is far more complex. He reinstated thousands of service members who were kicked out of the military for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine at the height of the pandemic. He pulled America out of the World Health Organization because, as Trump put it, it’s a rip-off. He reversed key Affordable Care Act elements introduced by Joe Biden that extended enrollment periods, reaffirmed coverage for preexisting conditions, and aimed to lower premiums. He revoked two Biden-administration executive orders that sought to protect access to abortion in the U.S., made plans to rejoin an international anti-abortion pact, and reinstated a ban on funding for overseas nongovernmental organizations that perform or promote abortions—despite election-cycle promises to leave abortion to the states.\\n\\nTrump is also derailing projects he previously indicated he might like. Even though he has long supported drug-pricing reforms, he rescinded a Biden executive order that created three new drug-pricing models to lower the cost of prescription drugs for people on Medicare and Medicaid.\\n\\nA decision on Kennedy’s confirmation is expected as soon as next week. If he takes control of the administration’s health-care strategy, its actions might start to look more coordinated. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy emphasized his desire to combat chronic diseases, suggesting that federal health research should aim to “identify the toxins that are contributing to chronic disease and eliminate them.” Chronic diseases are the leading cause of illness, disability, and death in America, though their causes go far beyond toxins in food and the environment.\\n\\nIn other areas of health policy, though, the flailing may continue. Kennedy appeared disinterested and at times confused when senators asked him about Medicare and Medicaid, which account for the majority of HHS’s budget. Kennedy has also spent decades spreading misinformation about the alleged harms of vaccines, but he told lawmakers at the first hearing that vaccines play a “critical” role in health care, that he supports the childhood-immunization schedule, and that he would not delay or alter how the Food and Drug Administration reviews vaccines. Perhaps the most telling exchange happened on the second day, when Senator Bill Cassidy, a doctor and Louisiana Republican, asked Kennedy whether he planned to reassure parents that vaccines for hepatitis B and measles do not cause autism. “If the data is there, I will absolutely do that,” Kennedy responded. But the data is there. Mountains of it, for decades. Such a basic disregard for scientific inquiry would make Kennedy fundamentally unpredictable as the head of American health.\\n\\nThe Trump administration’s present strategy has plunged much of the government’s health-care apparatus into disarray. The FDA is scrubbing mentions of diversity from its website, leaving researchers uncertain about whether they can still attempt to include diverse populations in clinical trials. Government scientists, as well as hospitals and other health-care providers that receive federal money, still don’t know how funding changes will affect their work. A system outage has left the National Science Foundation unable to pay researchers. The administration may well have plans for drug-pricing reforms and health farms in the works. But through all this chaos, it’s hard to see Trump’s vision for a healthier America.\", \"> Maybe I'm just too doomered at this point but we are getting what they wanted and I am so internally angry.\\n\\nI don't blame you and I'm sorry.

Instead, tariffs are imposed by executive branch regulation—but unlike most federal regulations, tariffs avoid almost all the legislated guardrails, administrative procedures, and judicial reviews that apply to other executive regulations.\\n\\nThe executive branch has the authority to impose tariffs through two different processes. First, a series of Trade Acts—enacted between the 1930s and 1970s—empower the executive branch to proclaim tariff rates to protect American workers and consumers from unfair trade practices. This is the authority that empowered President Trump to impose limited tariffs on products like solar panels and washing machines during his first administration. To invoke this authority, an investigation is initiated by either the Department of Commerce or the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether tariffs are necessary to remedy unfair trade practices. These investigations take some minimal time—including a 30-60 day notice-and-comment period that allows the public an opportunity to raise concerns—meaning that these authorities cannot realistically be used to impose new tariffs on trading partners on day one.\\n\\nInstead, if President Trump wishes to impose tariffs more quickly, he will likely need to invoke the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Under the IEEA, Congress grants authority to the executive branch to address “unusual and extraordinary” peacetime threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy.\\n\\nUnlike tariffs enacted under the various trade acts, those imposed under the IEEPA bypass departmental reports, reviews, and public notice-and-comment periods. This streamlines implementation but bypasses essentially all regulatory checks and balances.\\n\\n[Would you like to know more](', \"It's a shame they didn't have any hint that Trump might be planning this a month or two ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and the White House.\", \"It wouldn't have passed the republican controlled house a month or two ago.\", 'What makes you think we’re ever going to have free and fair elections again?', 'This is beyond reprehensible and irresponsible.

They also point to a high risk of miscommunication and escalation as Trump’s aggression collides with an affronted Panamanian elite.\\n\\nBalladares, sipping on iced coffee, argued that in an increasingly multipolar world, Trump is overplaying his hand. Fresh from a consultation at the presidential palace with his incumbent successor, José Raúl Mulino, Balladares said the only specific response they discussed was an appeal to the United Nations, which has since been made.\\n\\nBut Balladares raised the prospect that, if pushed, Panama could retaliate by opening up the choke points of another important flow: that of South American migrants heading north from Colombia.\\n\\n“One of the things that we might do, if, you know, if things become worse,” Balladares said, “is just open up the gates.”\\nTense Exchanges\\n\\nRubio’s visit is set to test whether direct, high-level diplomacy can contain a crisis that began with threats made by Trump on social media late last year — alongside complaints about toll prices and claims that Chinese soldiers operate the canal — and escalated since.\\n\\nIn public and private, Panamanians have protested the lack of factual basis for Trump’s claims about a Chinese military presence, pointed out that transit fees are uniform and dictated by law and appealed to the authority of multilateral institutions.\\n\\nPeople who have worked for Trump and are privy to the Panamanian response offer a familiar take: Mulino’s administration is taking Trump’s belligerent gripes literally when it should instead take the underlying message — don’t forget it’s the U.S. that built and defends the canal — seriously.\\n\\nInitial diplomatic exchanges have not yielded any resolution, according to the participant.\\n\\nTalks between Claver-Carone and Panamanian officials — including cabinet ministers and Ambassador to the U.S. José Healy — began in the waning days of the Biden administration, the person said.\\n\\nIn the course of those exchanges, Panamanian officials have fact-checked Trump’s claims and cited Luis Almagro, secretary-general of the Organization of American States, a U.N.-type body for the Western Hemisphere. Almagro posted in December on X, “We expect the fullest and unrestricted compliance with the Agreements signed, approved and in force between the two countries.”\\n\\nThe message back from Claver-Carone has amounted to, “I don’t care what the secretary-general of OAS says, I don’t care what some columnist says. ... Do you think that we give a shit?” according to the person.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Panamanian embassy in Washington, Siria Miranda, said she was unable to substantiate this account. The State Department’s press office did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nSo far, one concession has been forthcoming: On the day of Trump’s inauguration, Panamanian government auditors descended on two ports, located at each end of the canal, operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings. But the deployment of auditors to scrutinize the company’s compliance with its port concession agreements did not contain the crisis.\\n\\nIn his inaugural address on the same day, Trump vowed to “take back” the canal, which the U.S. handed over to Panama in 1999. Mulino responded with a complaint to the U.N. Security Council that cited Panama’s rights under international law. This week, the Panamanian president reiterated his stance that control of the canal is not up for negotiation.\\n\\nIn the lead up to Rubio’s arrival, though, came a signal that the Trump administration is ready to temper its approach.\\n\\n“I think it’s clear this is an issue about developing a relationship,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told Fox Business on Tuesday. “Not about bossing other nations around, but making it clear that a partnership with the United States is something that they can trust, something that comes with benefits just like any good relationship does.”\\n‘China Was Everywhere’\\n\\nWith or without Trump’s threats, China’s presence here has become a sticking point in U.S.-Panama relations as Beijing has made significant inroads into Latin America over the past decade-plus.\\n\\nMany American critics who recoil at the American president’s rhetoric agree that the U.S. could do more to roll back Chinese encroachment in Latin America.\\n\\nPanamanian elites, on the other hand, are loath to step back from a lucrative trading partner whose presence they argue poses no real threat to American security interests.\\n\\nPanama’s small Chinese community — roughly 4 percent of the country’s 4.5 million inhabitants — traces its roots in the 19th century and the arrival of laborers who came to help build the railroad, then the canal, that cross the isthmus.\\n\\nToday, Chinese culture remains a minor but visible presence in the life of the capital.\\n\\nIn January, a popular park named for the late dictator Omar Torrijos — who negotiated the handover of the canal from Jimmy Carter — was decked out for the impending Chinese lunar new year. As a diplomatic crisis embroiled the city, families strolled through traditional ornamental gateways and past a cartoonish panda luxuriating in a teacup.\\n\\nAmerican concerns about Chinese encroachment here date back at least to the 1990s, and the awarding of a contract to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong-based firm, to operate a port at the canal. Hutchison won the concession despite a last-minute bid by Virginia-based Bechtel and interest from other American contractors.\\n\\nAfterward, conservatives in the U.S. began to raise the alarm about “Red China” gaining control of the canal via Hutchison, but the uproar was widely interpreted in Panama as sour grapes over the bidding outcome.\\n\\nChina’s next major round of advances here came during the presidency of Juan Carlos Varela, which saw Panama cut ties with Taiwan and switch its recognition to Beijing in 2017.\\n\\nA series of diplomatic and investment deals promptly followed.\\n\\nAmong the most striking signs of China’s growing presence were plans that emerged for a new Chinese embassy to be built on the Amador Peninsula, which juts out from the city into the Pacific Ocean. The plans would have allowed the raising of a Chinese flag on high ground overlooking the entrance to the canal.\\n\\n“All of sudden it just looked like China was everywhere in Panama” said Robert Evan Ellis, a professor of Latin American Studies at the U.S. Army War College.\\n\\nChina’s headway here was smoothed by its then-Ambassador Wei Qiang, who made himself a visible presence in the life of the capital. Wei, a fluent Spanish speaker, had a taste for Armani suits and other fine clothing that earned him the nickname “the tailor of Panama” in some quarters.\\n\\nFor much of the time that Wei was charming his way through the city, he had no American counterpart. The 2018 resignation of U.S. Ambassador John Feeley, who cited irreconcilable differences with Trump, left a vacuum that was not filled for more than four years.\\n\\nBut U.S. pressure and dwindling domestic enthusiasm eventually blunted Chinese progress.\\n\\nPlans for the embassy were scrapped in 2018 in the face of American pushback, and the momentum of Chinese-Panamanian relations seemed to reverse after Varela left office in 2019.\\n\\nA Chinese company’s proposal to build a high-speed rail line from Panama City to the northern city of David stalled under Varela’s successor, Laurentino Cortizo, whose government also revoked a port concession that had been awarded to a Chinese firm.\\n\\nLast March, Beijing appointed a new ambassador, Xu Xueyuan, who does not speak fluent Spanish and has been less outgoing than her predecessor. The Chinese embassy did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe personnel change was seen here, Ellis said, as “China’s downgrading of the relationship and downgrading their expectations of what was possible.”\\n‘Typical New Yorker Bull’\\n\\nThe rolling back of China’s reach under Cortizo is just one reason that Panamanian leaders feel blindsided by Trump.\\n\\n**(Continued)**', \"wouldn't be the first time.

Targeted disabilities are a set of statutorily defined disabilities, including, but not limited to, those cited by Mr. Trump, that the federal government emphasizes for recruiting. An [archived page from June 2019](  named the initiative the Aviation Development Program, which “provides an opportunity for persons with targeted disabilities to gain aviation knowledge and experience as an air traffic control student trainee.”\\n\\n**“The candidates in this program will receive the same rigorous consideration in terms of aptitude, medical and security qualifications as those individuals considered for a standard public opening for air traffic controller jobs,”** the F.A.A. said in 2019.

The [shortage]( of air traffic controllers has been a years long issue and while the [FFA]( has made a lot of progress recently the [timeline]( to go from a new hire starting at the academy to becoming a fully certified professional controller (CPC) usually ranges from 6 months to 5 years depending on the individual candidate’s background and where they are stationed.

Shortly after taking office, Trump pardoned about 1,500 of the rioters and commuted others’ sentences.\\n\\nThere is no precedent for the mass termination of FBI personnel in this fashion.

Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration”.\\n\\nAny mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the justice department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump.\\n\\nThe FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were “fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI agents”.\\n\\n“Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure,” the association said in a statement.\\n\\nWhen pressed during his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees.\\n\\nAsked by the Democratic senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that didn’t follow that standard process, Patel said: “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there, but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.”\\n\\nBefore he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called anti-Trump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out.\\n\\n\\nTrump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and the justice department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the past four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks after his win in November.\\n\\nAsked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: “No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen before. They came after a lot of people – like me – but they came after a lot of people.”\\n\\nHe added: “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing, because they were very bad.”\\n\\nThe FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.\\n\\nThe Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them – including the ones convicted of violent crimes – through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments.\\n\\nThis week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives – including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge of big-city field offices – have been told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday.\\n\\nWith Associated Press', 'RESIST!

Copy may not be in its final form.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman.\\n\\nWe turn now to several confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill for President Trump’s Cabinet members, beginning with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who faced a second day of hearings for health secretary. Kennedy has previously campaigned as pro-choice, but during the hearing he repeatedly said he believes, quote, “every abortion is a tragedy,” and vowed to implement Trump’s policies. He also gave incorrect information about Medicare and Medicaid.\\n\\nKennedy’s long record of vaccine skepticism was a major focus. He repeatedly refused to disavow the debunked link between vaccines and autism and refused to acknowledge COVID vaccines are lifesaving. But he ended with this claim:\\n> \\n> ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: Before I conclude, I want to make sure this committee is clear about a few things. News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I’m anti-vaccine and anti-industry. Well, I’m neither. I’m pro-safety. I’m pro-good science. I worked for 40 years to raise awareness about mercury and other toxics in fish, and nobody called me anti-fish. All my kids are vaccinated. I believe vaccines have saved millions of lives and play a critical role in healthcare.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: In the same hearing on Thursday, Kennedy defended his trip to Samoa in June of 2019, four months before a measles outbreak was declared that killed 83 people, mostly children. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense offered to finance the trip. This is Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts questioning Kennedy about that trip.\\n> \\n> SEN. ED MARKEY: So, let me just follow through now, 2019. So, now, in October of 2019, the CDC declared a measles outbreak in Samoa. And in November, Samoa started a mass vaccination campaign to stop the outbreak. That same month, November of 2019, after 16 people had already died from the outbreak and Samoa was trying to respond to the crisis, you sent a letter to the prime minister of Samoa stating that, quote, “It is a regrettable possibility that these children are [casualties] of the vaccine.” By unanimous consent, I will introduce that letter into the record.\\n> \\n> SEN. BILL CASSIDY: Without objection.\\n> \\n> SEN. ED MARKEY: So, as Samoa was trying to contain the outbreak, you were saying that it was the fault of the vaccine, rather than the absence of vaccinations, that caused the outbreak in Samoa in the same year you visited Samoa.\\n> \\n> ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: And I replied to that, Senator — \\n> \\n> SEN. ED MARKEY: Now, the death count — let me — let me just finish. The death count in Samoa grew to 83. And ultimately, volunteers in New Zealand sent tiny coffins to help bury the dozens of children who died. And the Samoan director general of health later said, “With his last name and the status attached to it, people will believe him. People will believe Robert Kennedy.”\\n> \\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that was Senator Markey. This week, Samoa’s prime minister criticized RFK Jr.'s vaccine views and said she's surprised by his nomination for health secretary.\\n\\nFor more, we’re joined by two guests, but we’re going to begin in Apia, the capital of Samoa. We’ll begin with Aiono Dr. Alec Ekeroma, who is the current director general of health for Samoa’s Health Ministry.\\n\\nDoctor, welcome to Democracy Now! Thanks for joining us from Samoa. Can you explain? For two days we’ve heard about Samoa. Explain exactly what happened in 2019.\\n\\nDR. ALEC EKEROMA: Thank you very much for the opportunity.\\n\\nIn 2019, Samoa had a very low vaccination rate, and that was because of some problems back in 2018 with a matching-mixing of vaccines that resulted in two deaths. And so, therefore, we had a low vaccination rate already. And then Kennedy visited, before the measles outbreak. Now, the measles outbreak, of course, it came from New Zealand across the islands, and because of a low vaccination rate, it just took off, and so resulting in so many deaths.\\n\\nBut the government responded quickly and demanded a vaccine campaign — vaccination campaign, and there was some international assistance to Samoa from all countries in the world, who came across — doctors and nurses came across to Samoa to help with the mass vaccination of our people. So, that drove the vaccination up, rate up, to 90%, within a few months.\\n\\nSo, Kennedy’s presence in Samoa a few months before that actually emboldened the anti-vaxxers locally and also from New Zealand. And so, they were the ones, really, that tried to sow the vaccine hesitancy in the country. But, fortunately, our leaders did not believe that and mounted this emergency and mass vaccination campaign.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: Why did Kennedy go to Samoa?\\n\\nDR. ALEC EKEROMA: Apparently, he came to talk about some database that they could create. But when he was here, he talked to — well, he talked to the director — the then-director general of health and to the prime minister, but he also talked to local anti-vaxxers, as well. So, I’m not privy to what was discussed, but the result of his visit didn’t result in any improvements in our ICT or software capabilities in the country. None was promised.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to bring our other guest into this conversation. As we talk to the health director in Samoa, I also want to bring Brian Deer in, who was there in 2018 — in 2019 in the midst of the measles outbreak. He’s an investigative journalist and author of The Doctor Who Fooled the World. His recent New York Times opinion piece, “I’ll Never Forget What Kennedy Did During Samoa’s Measles Outbreak.” So, can you elaborate further on what Dr. Ekeroma is saying?\\n\\nBRIAN DEER: Good morning, Amy.\\n\\nYes, indeed, I was out in Samoa at the time, and I spent a great deal of my time there speaking to the mothers of children who died from measles. And it was the most emotional experience, and I ended my time there just crying, as I became overcome by the pain of these mothers. Eighty-three people died, overwhelmingly small children.\\n\\nNow, Mr. Kennedy thinks he knows better than anybody else. He claims that he’s not anti-vaccine. I’ve been following what is now called the anti-vaccine movement for 25 years. And I can assure you that Mr. Kennedy is not only an anti-vaccine campaigner, he is the preeminent anti-vaccine campaigner in the world. And he went to Samoa, and after the outbreak began, he then wrote to the prime minister, trying to suggest that it wasn’t, in fact, the virus at all that was killing these children, but was, in fact, the responsibility of the vaccine itself.\\n\\nAnd he didn’t stop there. Even this week, speaking to senators, he claimed that nobody knows what these children died from, even though the measles was — the vaccine there had collapsed as a result of other issues. And then, after a vaccination campaign that followed the outbreak, or took part — occurred at the same time as the outbreak, the children stopped dying. But Mr. Kennedy felt that he should tell senators that nobody knows what killed those children — extraordinary thing for him to say.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: What do you think, Brian Deer — and then I want to ask the health minister in Samoa — of him being the health secretary, the secretary of health and human services of the United States?\\n\\nBRIAN DEER: Well, I have to say, listening to him over the last couple of days, Amy, that I was shocked by the attitude he displayed. He was making it absolutely clear that notwithstanding him being the — hoping to become the head of an agency with a $2,000 billion budget and employing 90,000 people, he was going to personally involve himself in vaccine science, and it would be he who would be deciding whether the research was conducted properly, even though he has no medical or scientific qualifications at all, and not the enormous staff he represents and the agencies, that have actually written to him previously telling him that the research overwhelmingly and conclusively shows that there is no link between vaccines and, for example, autism. He was making it absolutely clear to senators that he was going to — in that job, with those enormous responsibilities, for that massive entity, he was going to involve himself in the individual pieces of research and deciding for himself whether vaccines, for example, cause autism.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: And before we leave Samoa, Dr. Alec Ekeroma, if you can talk about the significance of if he is confirmed as health secretary here in the U.S.?\\n\\nDR. ALEC EKEROMA: It is quite significant. Someone who is prominent in the world, with a [inaudible], spitting out anti-vaccine sentiments, emboldening anti-vaxxers around the world and in Samoa, is going to be a public health disaster for us. Already, we’re going to have reduction in U.S. funding to United Nations and to WHO that is going to affect our capability here. And then you add in Bob Kennedy into this role, that is going to slow down the flow of vaccines to us, that is going to harm our public health state in this country. And so, therefore, it will be a disaster for us.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you, Dr. Alec Ekeroma, for joining us, director general of health for Samoa’s Health Ministry.\", \"It's never been about expertise.

Murrow held sway, are steaming over the prospect that parent corporation Paramount Global may settle a $10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by now-President Donald Trump against “60” that appears to be underpinned by weak arguments.\\n\\nTwo reports in recent weeks, one posted Thursday by The New York Times and another earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal, suggested executives at Paramount were considering ways to bring the suit to a close. Filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas in November, the suit alleges “60 Minutes” tried to mislead voters by airing two different edits of remarks made in an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, then Trump’s rival for the White House. CBS sought to have the case thrown out in a subsequent filing. \\n\\n Though the suit is seen as shoddily constructed by legal experts, it is levied as Paramount is moving to be acquired by Skydance Media, a transaction worth billions to Shari Redstone, the controlling owner of Paramount through her family’s National Amusements Inc. theater chain. CBS News staffers believe Paramount and Redstone could seek a settlement in order to ensure the Skydance deal goes forward without substantial delay.\\n\\n A court filing on Friday suggested talks could be in the offing. Attorneys for President Trump filed a request to postpone a deadline to respond to CBS’ motion to dismiss by February 7. Such a motion doesn’t mean a settlement is near, but it could indicate the two sides are having discussions about potential outcomes. The extension was approved.\\n\\nBut there are also new pressures being brought to bear. ““Late Wednesday, CBS News was sent a Letter of Inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission asking for the full, unedited transcript and camera feeds from our interview with Vice President Harris which aired on October 7, 2024,” CBS News said in a Friday statement.  We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do.” The FCC has also reinstated a complaint made last year against New York’s WCBS, also part of Paramount, accusing the station of “intentional news distortion,” tied to the“60 Minutes” interview with Harris.\\n\\n“We’re helpless to whatever Shari and the bosses decide to do,” said one CBS News correspondent. “But it’s a real shame to think the news division is a bargaining chip in this broader deal.”\\n\\nSpokespersons for Paramount and CBS declined to comment. A spokesperson for Redstone declined to comment.\\n\\nAt least two of the company’s top news executives, CBS News and Stations CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, have made the point to superiors at Paramount corporate that they don’t believe the suit should be settled, according to a person familiar with the matter. Such a concession would not only undermine one of TV’s most respected journalism programs, but also demoralize CBS News staff. There is some speculation among CBS News employees that a settlement would spur intense blowback by some of CBS News’ most prominent anchors and personalities.\\n\\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a media-conglomerate CEO to keep close to a news division — Jeff Zucker was known to weigh in on the affairs of NBC News when he ran NBCUniversal under General Electric — Redstone sits at the level of the board of directors and has professional managers run the company. Even so, she has in recent months begun to weigh in on various controversies at CBS News — much more frequently than her father, Sumner Redstone, ever had, according to one CBS veteran\\n\\nIn October, Redstone took issue publicly after CBS News executives took issue with an exchange on “CBS Mornings” between co-anchor Tony Dokoupil and author Ta-Nehisi Coates during which Dokoupil grilled Coates on whether his writing expressed antipathy toward Israel. “I think we made a mistake,” said Redstone, while speaking at an event in New York City that was part of Advertising Week, an industry conference. “I think we made a bad mistake this week.”\\n\\nShe is said to have gotten involved earlier this month after “60 Minutes” broadcast a segment that examined opposition by former State Department officials to the Biden administration supporting Israel’s push against Hamas. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the segment “a biased and one-sided piece” in a statement, noting that “Even before this, CBS had a recent history of insensitivity on Jewish issues that was incredibly problematic.” CBS News quickly named Susan Zirinsky, a former president of the news operation, as an interim executive editor, tasked with overseeing standards and helping to vet stories and journalistic practices.\\n\\nA growing number of media organizations have tried to placate President Trump in recent weeks. Disney’s commitment to ABC News came under scrutiny after the company agreed to pay a settlement of $15 million to Donald Trump’s presidential library after anchor George Stephanopoulos asserted incorrectly in March said on air that Trump had been found liable in a court case for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. Trump had been found liable by a jury for sexual abuse. Even so, legal experts felt ABC News had a strong chance of prevailing.

Joseph Stalin\\xa0edited\\xa0photographs to remove rivals whose executions he ordered. Nazis\\xa0dynamited\\xa0the gas chambers and crematoria at Auschwitz in 1945 to hide the evidence of the Holocaust from the advancing Red Army.\\xa0\\n\\n> Today, we see similar attempts to erase, distort, and censor history in a host of countries, from\\xa0Turkey\\xa0to\\xa0China\\xa0to\\xa0India\\xa0to\\xa0Russia. Under these regimes, authorities exert strict control over history, and “official narratives” determine what can, or cannot, safely be said about the past.\\xa0\\n\\n> In the United States, the question of who controls historical knowledge is\\xa0once again\\xa0front and center, and there are worrying signs of increasing repression. According to PEN America, 361 educational\\xa0gag orders\\xa0have been introduced by state legislatures since 2021. Many of these laws specifically target history education.\\n\\n...\\n\\n> Another Czech intellectual, Václav Havel, can help us see where this is leading. Before he became president of Czechoslovakia following the collapse of communism in 1989, Havel was a dissident playwright who sometimes penned dangerously honest open letters to government leaders. These provocations landed Havel in prison on four separate occasions.\\n\\n> Havel’s best-known essay,\\xa0“The Power of the Powerless,”\\xa0concerns life under “post-totalitarian” dictatorship and the demoralizing effects of living in truth-deprived conditions. It is about the exhaustion of revolutionary politics, and what remains when the ruling party has proven its incompetence, but still exercises unchallenged power.\\xa0\\n\\n> In the essay, Havel writes: “Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must falsify everything. It falsifies the past. It falsifies the present, and it falsifies the future. It falsifies statistics. It pretends not to possess an omnipotent and unprincipled police apparatus. It pretends to respect human rights. It pretends to persecute no one. It pretends to fear nothing. It pretends to pretend nothing.”\\n\\n> Toward the end of the essay, Havel warns that the conditions in his country should serve as a warning to Western democracies. When bad actors are given free rein and the electorate is sufficiently deluded or discouraged, democracies can easily tip toward the conditions Havel elucidated. Not every form of subservience is imposed; some are willingly accepted.

He and, as alarmingly, Vought will liely sail through their votes. Only Gabbard and RFK Jr. show signs of potential strain. \\n\\n**Text copy**\\n\\n**Kash Patel Is a Crackpot**\\n\\n**The Economist, 2025**\\n\\nKash Patel likes conspiracy theories. Luckily for everyone else, conspiracists are normally kept far away from America’s federal law-enforcement and intelligence machinery, with all its powers of surveillance, investigation and arrest. Donald Trump has tested this premise in his choice of Mr Patel to lead the FBI. The 44-year-old lawyer—whose Senate confirmation hearing was on January 30th—has called that organisation “one of the most cunning and powerful forces of the deep state”. If Mr Trump follows through on his occasional threats to retaliate against his enemies, that task may fall to his nominee.\\n\\nLike Pete Hegseth, who won confirmation as defence secretary by a whisker, in pre-Trump times Mr Patel would have had little chance of running a government agency, let alone one this size. The FBI has 38,000 employees, 55 field offices and an $11bn budget. He lacks management experience, scorns the organisation, and his partisanship flouts a post-Watergate norm that law enforcement and intelligence gathering must be insulated from politics.\\n\\nMr Patel’s animus towards the national-security establishment started with the Trump-Russia probe. As a congressional aide, Mr Patel seized on real faults in the investigation, then exaggerated them. An FBI lawyer had doctored an email to support an application to wiretap a Trump campaign adviser; this was illegal, and Mr Patel helped expose it. In his telling, however, he discredited the whole inquiry as a nefarious plot to undermine Mr Trump, orchestrated by the justice department (DoJ) and the intelligence agencies. Mr Patel has called former top brass at the DoJ and the FBI corrupt “crooks” and “gangsters” and asked: “Who’s arresting these guys?”\\n\\nPerhaps he will. An appendix to Mr Patel’s book names 60 deep-state baddies. Democrats call it the Trump administration’s “enemies list”. Steve Bannon, a MAGA troublemaker, recently conceded that the book “might not be a literary thing”—“more typing than writing”—but said that the list is a good preview of future targets. The president offered a more ambiguous preview on inauguration day when he ordered the attorney-general to scour the DoJ for past instances of lawfare and seek “remedial actions”. By lawfare he meant the two (now dismissed) federal indictments against him and the FBI’s raid of Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. Already more than a dozen DoJ lawyers who brought those cases have been fired.\\n\\nActual prosecutions against the president’s enemies would be hard. They would contend with judges, juries, defence lawyers and evidentiary rules. Investigations of the type Mr Patel would oversee involve fewer constraints. This is especially true when the FBI can cobble together a national-security justification. Then judicial review for, say, a wiretap becomes less burdensome. Everything is classified to boot.\\n\\nAt the FBI, a culture of complying with the law will militate against baseless expeditions, says Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and former adviser at the bureau under James Comey, the director whom Mr Trump fired in 2017. But line agents and prosecutors will find it hard to object to an inquiry where there is a coherent basis for one, even if the motives behind it are political. Meanwhile, probes exact punishing costs from their targets.\\n\\nMr Patel is especially keen on pursuing leakers and their friends in the media. “When you have an underlying illegality committed by a government agent, anyone that participates in that illegality can and should be charged,” Mr Patel has said. He has also suggested “clawback mechanisms” for the money that news outlets make “by printing lies”.\\n\\nEqually significant is what Mr Patel might deprioritise at the FBI: namely, investigations of far-right activity. This may pick up as groups that went quiet after January 6th re-form thanks to Mr Trump’s pardons. Mr Patel has insinuated that the FBI had a hand in the insurrection. That is a MAGA conspiracy theory, built on the fact that 26 FBI informants were there that day, including four who entered the Capitol. In truth the riot was among the largest intelligence failures in FBI history.\\n\\nThe fact that Mr Patel is even in contention for the FBI job underscores how much has changed between the two Trump administrations. In the first term, the president moved to install him as deputy director of the cia. Gina Haspel, then its boss, threatened to quit and Mr Trump backed down. He tried the same gambit at the FBI before Bill Barr intervened. Both Ms Haspel and Mr Barr had stature accrued over long, distinguished careers; with that came the wherewithal to say no. Mr Patel, by contrast, owes his ascendancy to Mr Trump. On a podcast last year, he intimated how he would handle a lawful but awful order from the president. “If the guy gives me a lawful chain-of-command authority, you want me to not execute it?”■\\n\\n(Edited to add note at top)\", \"Let's hope this fall guy misses the bag and lands in shit.\", 'Thanks for your post.

They view these groups as \"lesser than\" and undeserving of the same rights, freedoms, privileges and immunities that they feel they are owed above anyone else.\\n\\nOnly *they* are entitled to those rights and freedoms that are granted to them and protected by the Constitution. Only they are entitled to power, ownership and control. Only *they* are exempt from the law, only *they* can abuse their authority, only *they* can use the justice system to exact vengeance upon their enemies...\\n\\nIn the end, something as simple as pronouns represents a major threat to everything they hold dear. It\\'s absurd...

Canada sends us, in volume, 60% of ALL crude oil we process. \n\nBy barrels per day required for production, if we stopped receiving their oil, every single oil refinery would shut down in every single state except TEXAS (30% of all production). This as not even counting oil that is refined into other various petro-chem uses/plastics/jellies. Literally just the Oil -> Refined fuel product pipeline. \n\nIf we DO still receive it, the margin for profit is RAZOR THIN, currently. An oil barrel is 42 gallons. The profit on a gallon of oil to fuel per barrel is less than fifty cents per gallon basically everywhere (25 cents Gulf Coast, ~35 cents near Chicago)  for less than $20 gained per barrel in areas with the HIGHEST profit margin in the US. The midwest has a higher shipping cost from Canada, and Louisiana, for example, produces using domestic crude with a somewhat higher margin. That being said..\n\nWith a 10% tariff on Oil, fuel production shuts off. The country will simply not be able to produce the same amount of refined fuel products without cutting into our (also extremely high ) raw crude exports, meaning it would effectively stunt the economy twice. That's not even counting plastics etc mentioned above. \n\nIt's gonna be nuts. He doesn't know what he's doing, and if he does it, he's going to feel the hurt immediately.

The House GOP plans to extend those provisions and add other business tax incentives, at a cost of $5.5 trillion over a decade.

Joseph Stalin edited photographs to remove rivals whose executions he ordered. Nazis dynamited the gas chambers and crematoria at Auschwitz in 1945 to hide the evidence of the Holocaust from the advancing Red Army. \n\n> Today, we see similar attempts to erase, distort, and censor history in a host of countries, from Turkey to China to India to Russia. Under these regimes, authorities exert strict control over history, and “official narratives” determine what can, or cannot, safely be said about the past. \n\n> In the United States, the question of who controls historical knowledge is once again front and center, and there are worrying signs of increasing repression. According to PEN America, 361 educational gag orders have been introduced by state legislatures since 2021. Many of these laws specifically target history education.\n\n...\n\n> Another Czech intellectual, Václav Havel, can help us see where this is leading. Before he became president of Czechoslovakia following the collapse of communism in 1989, Havel was a dissident playwright who sometimes penned dangerously honest open letters to government leaders. These provocations landed Havel in prison on four separate occasions.\n\n> Havel’s best-known essay, “The Power of the Powerless,” concerns life under “post-totalitarian” dictatorship and the demoralizing effects of living in truth-deprived conditions. It is about the exhaustion of revolutionary politics, and what remains when the ruling party has proven its incompetence, but still exercises unchallenged power. \n\n> In the essay, Havel writes: “Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must falsify everything. It falsifies the past. It falsifies the present, and it falsifies the future. It falsifies statistics. It pretends not to possess an omnipotent and unprincipled police apparatus. It pretends to respect human rights. It pretends to persecute no one. It pretends to fear nothing. It pretends to pretend nothing.”\n\n> Toward the end of the essay, Havel warns that the conditions in his country should serve as a warning to Western democracies. When bad actors are given free rein and the electorate is sufficiently deluded or discouraged, democracies can easily tip toward the conditions Havel elucidated. Not every form of subservience is imposed; some are willingly accepted. If the regime pretends not to pretend, it is up to ordinary citizens whether they will play along.",

Women are able to get an abortion when their life is endangered by the pregnancy, or if the baby will be born with severe deformities or disabilities. Religious ethical committees must rule on the ethics and legality of the abortion before it can be carried out. After ethical approval of the abortion, the woman must obtain approval from a gynecologist, three general practitioners, a counselor, and permission of the doctor. One additional situation that occasionally allows abortion to occur is poverty. This is especially prominent in areas that the Taliban is still present in. Within Taliban controlled areas, poverty based abortions are generally approved more often because they have too many children.\n\nSo the Taliban is far more permissive on abortion rights than many US states.

          "This is a prime example of how conservatives operate.\n\nFor one, it's just another petty, symbolic gesture tied to the MAGA culture wars. Over the years, Republicans have  developed an agenda that's almost entirely centered around their culture wars. It's become their unifying cause.\n\nAs a result, Republicans in power have focused their voter's attention on these kinds of redundant issues that they intentionally magnify and blow out of proportion.\n\nIt turns into a fixation. And Republicans capitalize off of this by riling up their base into some kind of patriotic frenzy, convincing them that things like pronouns are deserving of their rage and contempt...\n\nIronically, it's conservatives who become obsessed with these things. It's conservatives who are constantly fixated on pronouns, gender this or that, race related matters, sexual orientation and so on...\n\nRepublicans have created an entire platform that exists within this culture war battleground.\n\nBy doing so, they prove that they're incapable of governing properly as they focus all of their efforts on issues that would otherwise be inconsequential, instead of using their power and resources to address *real* problems.\n\nTheir immediate goal is then to propose \"solutions\" to problems that they alone have escalated, problems viewed through a distorted and partisan lens, and in many cases, problems that they've either created (or compounded) themselves, or problems that they've deliberately exaggerated and deemed widespread and inescapable.\n\nWhat's more, by hyper focusing on these problems, they also end up appealing to conservative's grievances, to their *feelings,* entertaining their fears and conspiracy theories, pandering to their worst impulses, their phobias, their paranoia, and most of all, their prejudices, their hate and their discriminatory attitudes towards out-groups and people living on the margins of society. \n\nBy identifying all of the scapegoats and enemies that represent threat after threat to *their* culture, *their* race and religion, *their* communities, *their* country (not *our* country), and even their white, Christian hegemony, conservatives and Republican lawmakers can justify almost anything in the name of eliminating these threats.\n\nIt's fascism 101. \n\nIt all comes down to their feelings of superiority, their sense of entitlement and victimhood.\n\nIn their eyes, these radical leftist enemies and scapegoats pose a danger to their superiority. They view these groups as \"lesser than\" and undeserving of the same rights, freedoms, privileges and immunities that they feel they are owed above anyone else.\n\nOnly *they* are entitled to those rights and freedoms that are granted to them and protected by the Constitution. Only they are entitled to power, ownership and control. Only *they* are exempt from the law, only *they* can abuse their authority, only *they* can use the justice system to exact vengeance upon their enemies...\n\nIn the end, something as simple as pronouns represents a major threat to everything they hold dear. It's absurd... Which is why they become so much more obsessed with how others choose to live.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps what's most dishonest about all of this, is how effective Republicans are at distracting these voters from the fact that they are picking their pockets.\n\nAll of the fearmongering and propaganda, all of the scapegoating, all of this culture war bullshit is a distraction from the unsettling truth that Republicans do not have the best interests of most Americans at heart, that they are not governing on behalf of \"the people,\" but themselves, the special interests their protecting, the inequities their desperately trying to preserve, and their rich benefactors of course.",

          "[paywall free link](\n\n**Personal Note:** I'm of the view that it's as important to recognize how the 4th estate is responding to the new regime and its initiatives. This is a brief overview coming from The Economist, hardly a left mag like The New Republic or, on the far end, Jacobin, while most mainstream American media appears to be conditioning the nation to accept the absurd as quotidian. He and, as alarmingly, Vought will liely sail through their votes. Only Gabbard and RFK Jr. show signs of potential strain. \n\n**Text copy**\n\n**Kash Patel Is a Crackpot**\n\n**The Economist, 2025**\n\nKash Patel likes conspiracy theories. Luckily for everyone else, conspiracists are normally kept far away from America’s federal law-enforcement and intelligence machinery, with all its powers of surveillance, investigation and arrest. Donald Trump has tested this premise in his choice of Mr Patel to lead the FBI. The 44-year-old lawyer—whose Senate confirmation hearing was on January 30th—has called that organisation “one of the most cunning and powerful forces of the deep state”. If Mr Trump follows through on his occasional threats to retaliate against his enemies, that task may fall to his nominee.\n\nLike Pete Hegseth, who won confirmation as defence secretary by a whisker, in pre-Trump times Mr Patel would have had little chance of running a government agency, let alone one this size. The FBI has 38,000 employees, 55 field offices and an $11bn budget. He lacks management experience, scorns the organisation, and his partisanship flouts a post-Watergate norm that law enforcement and intelligence gathering must be insulated from politics.\n\nMr Patel’s animus towards the national-security establishment started with the Trump-Russia probe. As a congressional aide, Mr Patel seized on real faults in the investigation, then exaggerated them. An FBI lawyer had doctored an email to support an application to wiretap a Trump campaign adviser; this was illegal, and Mr Patel helped expose it. In his telling, however, he discredited the whole inquiry as a nefarious plot to undermine Mr Trump, orchestrated by the justice department (DoJ) and the intelligence agencies. Mr Patel has called former top brass at the DoJ and the FBI corrupt “crooks” and “gangsters” and asked: “Who’s arresting these guys?”\n\nPerhaps he will. An appendix to Mr Patel’s book names 60 deep-state baddies. Democrats call it the Trump administration’s “enemies list”. Steve Bannon, a MAGA troublemaker, recently conceded that the book “might not be a literary thing”—“more typing than writing”—but said that the list is a good preview of future targets. The president offered a more ambiguous preview on inauguration day when he ordered the attorney-general to scour the DoJ for past instances of lawfare and seek “remedial actions”. By lawfare he meant the two (now dismissed) federal indictments against him and the FBI’s raid of Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. Already more than a dozen DoJ lawyers who brought those cases have been fired.\n\nActual prosecutions against the president’s enemies would be hard. They would contend with judges, juries, defence lawyers and evidentiary rules. Investigations of the type Mr Patel would oversee involve fewer constraints. This is especially true when the FBI can cobble together a national-security justification. Then judicial review for, say, a wiretap becomes less burdensome. Everything is classified to boot.\n\nAt the FBI, a culture of complying with the law will militate against baseless expeditions, says Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and former adviser at the bureau under James Comey, the director whom Mr Trump fired in 2017. But line agents and prosecutors will find it hard to object to an inquiry where there is a coherent basis for one, even if the motives behind it are political. Meanwhile, probes exact punishing costs from their targets.\n\nMr Patel is especially keen on pursuing leakers and their friends in the media. “When you have an underlying illegality committed by a government agent, anyone that participates in that illegality can and should be charged,” Mr Patel has said. He has also suggested “clawback mechanisms” for the money that news outlets make “by printing lies”.\n\nEqually significant is what Mr Patel might deprioritise at the FBI: namely, investigations of far-right activity. This may pick up as groups that went quiet after January 6th re-form thanks to Mr Trump’s pardons. Mr Patel has insinuated that the FBI had a hand in the insurrection. That is a MAGA conspiracy theory, built on the fact that 26 FBI informants were there that day, including four who entered the Capitol. In truth the riot was among the largest intelligence failures in FBI history.\n\nThe fact that Mr Patel is even in contention for the FBI job underscores how much has changed between the two Trump administrations. In the first term, the president moved to install him as deputy director of the cia. Gina Haspel, then its boss, threatened to quit and Mr Trump backed down. He tried the same gambit at the FBI before Bill Barr intervened. Both Ms Haspel and Mr Barr had stature accrued over long, distinguished careers; with that came the wherewithal to say no. Mr Patel, by contrast, owes his ascendancy to Mr Trump. On a podcast last year, he intimated how he would handle a lawful but awful order from the president. “If the guy gives me a lawful chain-of-command authority, you want me to not execute it?”■\n\n(Edited to add note at top)",
          "Patel is a political operative.  Of course he is going to go after Trumps political enemies.  That is why he was nominated.  Petal has been very open about what he is going to do.  Patel will be the head of America's secret police. Patel will be Americans version of Himmler.",

          "Kash Patel is a MAGA loyalist who has repeatedly peddled false conspiracy theories and threatened to go after Trump’s political enemies. I have no doubt he has an enemies list. \n\nThe enemies list is a real threat. Remember, we’ve seen this before. In 1950, McCarthyism destroyed many lives. Senator Joseph McCarthy spread lies about Americans ties to communism, saying in a speech that he had a list of known communists, “enemies from within”. \n\nMcCarthy then went on to destroy lifelong careers and families that left a path of destruction. He investigated the State Department’s information program and its libraries, which included books by people McCarthy considered Communists. This was a dangerous part of our history.

          "Note: From today's *Democracy Now*. You can watch the interview [here]( or read/ read along the transcript below.\n\nTranscript\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn now to several confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill for President Trump’s Cabinet members, beginning with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who faced a second day of hearings for health secretary. Kennedy has previously campaigned as pro-choice, but during the hearing he repeatedly said he believes, quote, “every abortion is a tragedy,” and vowed to implement Trump’s policies. He also gave incorrect information about Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nKennedy’s long record of vaccine skepticism was a major focus. He repeatedly refused to disavow the debunked link between vaccines and autism and refused to acknowledge COVID vaccines are lifesaving. But he ended with this claim:\n> \n> ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: Before I conclude, I want to make sure this committee is clear about a few things. News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I’m anti-vaccine and anti-industry. Well, I’m neither. I’m pro-safety. I’m pro-good science. I worked for 40 years to raise awareness about mercury and other toxics in fish, and nobody called me anti-fish. All my kids are vaccinated. I believe vaccines have saved millions of lives and play a critical role in healthcare.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: In the same hearing on Thursday, Kennedy defended his trip to Samoa in June of 2019, four months before a measles outbreak was declared that killed 83 people, mostly children. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense offered to finance the trip. This is Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts questioning Kennedy about that trip.\n> \n> SEN. ED MARKEY: So, let me just follow through now, 2019. So, now, in October of 2019, the CDC declared a measles outbreak in Samoa. And in November, Samoa started a mass vaccination campaign to stop the outbreak. That same month, November of 2019, after 16 people had already died from the outbreak and Samoa was trying to respond to the crisis, you sent a letter to the prime minister of Samoa stating that, quote, “It is a regrettable possibility that these children are [casualties] of the vaccine.” By unanimous consent, I will introduce that letter into the record.\n> \n> SEN. BILL CASSIDY: Without objection.\n> \n> SEN. ED MARKEY: So, as Samoa was trying to contain the outbreak, you were saying that it was the fault of the vaccine, rather than the absence of vaccinations, that caused the outbreak in Samoa in the same year you visited Samoa.\n> \n> ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: And I replied to that, Senator — \n> \n> SEN. ED MARKEY: Now, the death count — let me — let me just finish. The death count in Samoa grew to 83. And ultimately, volunteers in New Zealand sent tiny coffins to help bury the dozens of children who died. And the Samoan director general of health later said, “With his last name and the status attached to it, people will believe him. People will believe Robert Kennedy.”\n> \nAMY GOODMAN: So, that was Senator Markey. This week, Samoa’s prime minister criticized RFK Jr.'s vaccine views and said she's surprised by his nomination for health secretary.\n\nFor more, we’re joined by two guests, but we’re going to begin in Apia, the capital of Samoa. We’ll begin with Aiono Dr. Alec Ekeroma, who is the current director general of health for Samoa’s Health Ministry.\n\nDoctor, welcome to Democracy Now! Thanks for joining us from Samoa. Can you explain? For two days we’ve heard about Samoa. Explain exactly what happened in 2019.\n\nDR. ALEC EKEROMA: Thank you very much for the opportunity.\n\nIn 2019, Samoa had a very low vaccination rate, and that was because of some problems back in 2018 with a matching-mixing of vaccines that resulted in two deaths. And so, therefore, we had a low vaccination rate already. And then Kennedy visited, before the measles outbreak. Now, the measles outbreak, of course, it came from New Zealand across the islands, and because of a low vaccination rate, it just took off, and so resulting in so many deaths.\n\nBut the government responded quickly and demanded a vaccine campaign — vaccination campaign, and there was some international assistance to Samoa from all countries in the world, who came across — doctors and nurses came across to Samoa to help with the mass vaccination of our people. So, that drove the vaccination up, rate up, to 90%, within a few months.\n\nSo, Kennedy’s presence in Samoa a few months before that actually emboldened the anti-vaxxers locally and also from New Zealand. And so, they were the ones, really, that tried to sow the vaccine hesitancy in the country. But, fortunately, our leaders did not believe that and mounted this emergency and mass vaccination campaign.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Why did Kennedy go to Samoa?\n\nDR. ALEC EKEROMA: Apparently, he came to talk about some database that they could create. But when he was here, he talked to — well, he talked to the director — the then-director general of health and to the prime minister, but he also talked to local anti-vaxxers, as well. So, I’m not privy to what was discussed, but the result of his visit didn’t result in any improvements in our ICT or software capabilities in the country. None was promised.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to bring our other guest into this conversation. As we talk to the health director in Samoa, I also want to bring Brian Deer in, who was there in 2018 — in 2019 in the midst of the measles outbreak. He’s an investigative journalist and author of The Doctor Who Fooled the World. His recent New York Times opinion piece, “I’ll Never Forget What Kennedy Did During Samoa’s Measles Outbreak.” So, can you elaborate further on what Dr. Ekeroma is saying?\n\nBRIAN DEER: Good morning, Amy.\n\nYes, indeed, I was out in Samoa at the time, and I spent a great deal of my time there speaking to the mothers of children who died from measles. And it was the most emotional experience, and I ended my time there just crying, as I became overcome by the pain of these mothers. Eighty-three people died, overwhelmingly small children.\n\nNow, Mr. Kennedy thinks he knows better than anybody else. He claims that he’s not anti-vaccine. I’ve been following what is now called the anti-vaccine movement for 25 years. And I can assure you that Mr. Kennedy is not only an anti-vaccine campaigner, he is the preeminent anti-vaccine campaigner in the world. And he went to Samoa, and after the outbreak began, he then wrote to the prime minister, trying to suggest that it wasn’t, in fact, the virus at all that was killing these children, but was, in fact, the responsibility of the vaccine itself.\n\nAnd he didn’t stop there. Even this week, speaking to senators, he claimed that nobody knows what these children died from, even though the measles was — the vaccine there had collapsed as a result of other issues. And then, after a vaccination campaign that followed the outbreak, or took part — occurred at the same time as the outbreak, the children stopped dying. But Mr. Kennedy felt that he should tell senators that nobody knows what killed those children — extraordinary thing for him to say.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: What do you think, Brian Deer — and then I want to ask the health minister in Samoa — of him being the health secretary, the secretary of health and human services of the United States?\n\nBRIAN DEER: Well, I have to say, listening to him over the last couple of days, Amy, that I was shocked by the attitude he displayed. He was making it absolutely clear that notwithstanding him being the — hoping to become the head of an agency with a $2,000 billion budget and employing 90,000 people, he was going to personally involve himself in vaccine science, and it would be he who would be deciding whether the research was conducted properly, even though he has no medical or scientific qualifications at all, and not the enormous staff he represents and the agencies, that have actually written to him previously telling him that the research overwhelmingly and conclusively shows that there is no link between vaccines and, for example, autism. He was making it absolutely clear to senators that he was going to — in that job, with those enormous responsibilities, for that massive entity, he was going to involve himself in the individual pieces of research and deciding for himself whether vaccines, for example, cause autism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And before we leave Samoa, Dr. Alec Ekeroma, if you can talk about the significance of if he is confirmed as health secretary here in the U.S.?\n\nDR. ALEC EKEROMA: It is quite significant. Someone who is prominent in the world, with a [inaudible], spitting out anti-vaccine sentiments, emboldening anti-vaxxers around the world and in Samoa, is going to be a public health disaster for us. Already, we’re going to have reduction in U.S. funding to United Nations and to WHO that is going to affect our capability here. And then you add in Bob Kennedy into this role, that is going to slow down the flow of vaccines to us, that is going to harm our public health state in this country. And so, therefore, it will be a disaster for us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you, Dr. Alec Ekeroma, for joining us, director general of health for Samoa’s Health Ministry.",

But the shift is never easy. For smaller companies, it may prove altogether unfeasible. The largest maker of outboard motors in the United States employs only about 5,000 people. It is furloughing and laying off more than a quarter of its workforce. This type of firm cannot easily fly into Hanoi to source a reliable replacement for its trusted components supplier in Shenzhen, China. The challenge is only greater when the U.S. manufacturer has no idea how long the Trump tariffs will last. It will probably continue to use its familiar suppliers, pay the tariff, raise its prices, and suffer the stagnation and shrinkage of its business.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Third, “illegal” is irrelevant; don’t expect relief from tariffs through lawsuits.\n>\n>...\n>\n>On trade, the U.S. itself has led the way back to the law of the jungle. Remember that fact when the other big cats strike back.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Fourth, Americans may not remember their past actions, but others do.\n>\n>...\n>\n>In the 21st century, the United States faces a new kind of adversary. Past rivals might have matched the U.S. in wealth, technology, or military strength, but not in all three. China today is the nearest peer power the U.S. has faced since Americans battled the British Empire in the War of 1812. To balance China while keeping the peace, the U.S. will need more and better friends than ever before. Trump is doing his utmost instead to alienate and offend those friends.\n>\n>“America First” means “America Alone.” This week’s trade wars are steps on the way to future difficulties—and, unless a great infusion of better judgment or better luck suddenly occurs, future disasters.\n\nThese were some useful reminders of some of the geopolitical realities that exist whether the current administration likes it or not. The complexities of today's interconnected world means that cooperation more than ever is necessary especially with some of the larger problems that we all face. No country, no matter how wealthy or influential, can afford to alienate their allies and partners without suffering themselves in that process. And the reminder that other countries don't forget is a timely one, not just for other countries in the Americas, but also when it comes to countries like China who are infamous for playing the long game.",

Adolf Hitler’s policy regarding the killing of disabled people was part of the T4 Euthanasia Program, officially known as Aktion T4. This program, implemented between 1939 and 1945, was a state-sponsored effort to systematically murder people with physical and mental disabilities in Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Nazis viewed people with disabilities as “life unworthy of life” (Lebensunwertes Leben) and a financial burden on society. This ideology was rooted in eugenics, which sought to “purify” the Aryan race. The program initially targeted institutionalized patients, who were either starved to death or killed using lethal injections. Later, gas chambers were introduced. Approximately 275,000 to 300,000 individuals with disabilities, including children and adults, were murdered under Aktion T4 and related euthanasia. Remarkably, due to opposition from religious leaders and the general public, Hitler officially halted the program in August 1941.",

          "Some useful bits of background along with some analysis:\n\n>Trump had been critical of NAFTA before he ever reached the White House. CUSMA was negotiated during his first term in the Oval Office.\n>\n>Canada, Mexico and the U.S. agreed to terms on the CUSMA deal in the fall of 2018, but it was further amended the following year before ratification eventually occurred in 2020.\n>\n>The Canadian government's summary of CUSMA's outcomes says the agreement aimed to reinforce the economic ties among the three parties while preserving the trade benefits that NAFTA brought, with some adjustments \"to address modern-day trade challenges and opportunities.\"\n>\n>Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative during Trump's first administration, at the time hailed CUSMA's emergence as \"a landmark achievement\" in efforts to spur manufacturing and investment in the North American economy.\n>\n>...\n>\n>In the spring of 2018, a Trump-led White House cited national security when targeting Canadian steel with 25 per cent tariffs and aluminum with 10 per cent tariffs. Ottawa retaliated with tariffs of its own. It wasn't until nearly a year later, however, that the two sides announced they were withdrawing tariffs.\n>\n>But Trump again turned to tariffs in August 2020, slapping a 10 per cent tariff on Canadian aluminum, again citing national security when imposing them. Canada, in turn, threatened retaliatory measures, and on that occasion, the U.S. president paused the tariffs the following month.\n>\n>A series of exceptions are laid out in CUSMA including an article on \"essential security,\" which states that nothing in the agreement precludes the any of the parties from \"applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n>\n>...\n>\n>Hearing Trump and other administration officials invoke concerns about fentanyl trafficking and migration, Brown said the president's administration may well be accordingly driving toward \"a national security-type exception\" to justify tariffs.\n>\n>...\n>\n>On a broader level, Brown said Trump does not appear \"to feel overly constricted\" by the international rules-based order that has long governed trade. That may have implications for what to expect from his administration.\n>\n>\"I don't think he's ready to tear it up completely,\" Brown cautioned, noting Trump has indicated he wants to renegotiate CUSMA.\n>\n>Van Harten argues that Trump's recent actions amount to \"a whole policy shift that takes us out of this whole globalization era,\" with his administration's stated focus on putting America first.\n\nIt looks pretty clear that even though CUSMA was Trump's own agreement, he's looking to tear it down and renegotiate yet again. Given that these agreements are supposed to bring stability to critical trade relationships, these ongoing attacks on these agreements by the president have been introducing more instability to the process. In the short term this might be to the president's advantage, but in the long term this might cause countries and companies to look elsewhere for more stable relationships.",

It's a cynical and dark world.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n**CBS News Staffers Irate Over Talk of Paramount Settling Trump’s ’60 Minutes’ Lawsuit** \n\n**Brian Steinberg**\n\n**Variety , January 30 2025**\n\n Paramount Global and CBS News may have very different views on the journalism produced each week by “60 Minutes.”\n\nStaffers at CBS News, the unit that serves as home to the venerable newsmagazine as well as “CBS Evening News” and has ties to the early days of TV news when Edward R. Murrow held sway, are steaming over the prospect that parent corporation Paramount Global may settle a $10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by now-President Donald Trump against “60” that appears to be underpinned by weak arguments.\n\nTwo reports in recent weeks, one posted Thursday by The New York Times and another earlier this month by The Wall Street Journal, suggested executives at Paramount were considering ways to bring the suit to a close. Filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas in November, the suit alleges “60 Minutes” tried to mislead voters by airing two different edits of remarks made in an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, then Trump’s rival for the White House. CBS sought to have the case thrown out in a subsequent filing. \n\n Though the suit is seen as shoddily constructed by legal experts, it is levied as Paramount is moving to be acquired by Skydance Media, a transaction worth billions to Shari Redstone, the controlling owner of Paramount through her family’s National Amusements Inc. theater chain. CBS News staffers believe Paramount and Redstone could seek a settlement in order to ensure the Skydance deal goes forward without substantial delay.\n\n A court filing on Friday suggested talks could be in the offing. Attorneys for President Trump filed a request to postpone a deadline to respond to CBS’ motion to dismiss by February 7. Such a motion doesn’t mean a settlement is near, but it could indicate the two sides are having discussions about potential outcomes. The extension was approved.\n\nBut there are also new pressures being brought to bear. ““Late Wednesday, CBS News was sent a Letter of Inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission asking for the full, unedited transcript and camera feeds from our interview with Vice President Harris which aired on October 7, 2024,” CBS News said in a Friday statement.  We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do.” The FCC has also reinstated a complaint made last year against New York’s WCBS, also part of Paramount, accusing the station of “intentional news distortion,” tied to the“60 Minutes” interview with Harris.\n\n“We’re helpless to whatever Shari and the bosses decide to do,” said one CBS News correspondent. “But it’s a real shame to think the news division is a bargaining chip in this broader deal.”\n\nSpokespersons for Paramount and CBS declined to comment. A spokesperson for Redstone declined to comment.\n\nAt least two of the company’s top news executives, CBS News and Stations CEO Wendy McMahon and “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, have made the point to superiors at Paramount corporate that they don’t believe the suit should be settled, according to a person familiar with the matter. Such a concession would not only undermine one of TV’s most respected journalism programs, but also demoralize CBS News staff. There is some speculation among CBS News employees that a settlement would spur intense blowback by some of CBS News’ most prominent anchors and personalities.\n\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a media-conglomerate CEO to keep close to a news division — Jeff Zucker was known to weigh in on the affairs of NBC News when he ran NBCUniversal under General Electric — Redstone sits at the level of the board of directors and has professional managers run the company. Even so, she has in recent months begun to weigh in on various controversies at CBS News — much more frequently than her father, Sumner Redstone, ever had, according to one CBS veteran\n\nIn October, Redstone took issue publicly after CBS News executives took issue with an exchange on “CBS Mornings” between co-anchor Tony Dokoupil and author Ta-Nehisi Coates during which Dokoupil grilled Coates on whether his writing expressed antipathy toward Israel. “I think we made a mistake,” said Redstone, while speaking at an event in New York City that was part of Advertising Week, an industry conference. “I think we made a bad mistake this week.”\n\nShe is said to have gotten involved earlier this month after “60 Minutes” broadcast a segment that examined opposition by former State Department officials to the Biden administration supporting Israel’s push against Hamas. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the segment “a biased and one-sided piece” in a statement, noting that “Even before this, CBS had a recent history of insensitivity on Jewish issues that was incredibly problematic.” CBS News quickly named Susan Zirinsky, a former president of the news operation, as an interim executive editor, tasked with overseeing standards and helping to vet stories and journalistic practices.\n\nA growing number of media organizations have tried to placate President Trump in recent weeks. Disney’s commitment to ABC News came under scrutiny after the company agreed to pay a settlement of $15 million to Donald Trump’s presidential library after anchor George Stephanopoulos asserted incorrectly in March said on air that Trump had been found liable in a court case for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. Trump had been found liable by a jury for sexual abuse. Even so, legal experts felt ABC News had a strong chance of prevailing. Amazon has agreed to produce a documentary of First Lady Melania Trump.\n\n(Edited mistype at top)",

          " Musk’s DOGE clashes with Treasury over access to payment system, report says\n\nLongtime official retires after clash \"over access to sensitive payment systems.\" \n\nJon Brodkin – Jan 31, 2025 12:25 PM\nArs Technica\n\nA longtime Treasury Department official is leaving his job after a dispute with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has reportedly been seeking access to federal payment systems.\n\n\"The highest-ranking career official at the Treasury Department is departing after a clash with allies of billionaire Elon Musk over access to sensitive payment systems,\" The Washington Post reported today, citing three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe departing official is Fiscal Assistant Secretary David Lebryk, who has served in nonpolitical Treasury Department roles during his career of more than 30 years. President Donald Trump named Lebryk the acting secretary of the Treasury, an additional role he held for a week before political appointee Scott Bessent was confirmed by the Senate. But Lebryk \"announced his retirement Friday in an email to colleagues obtained by The Washington Post,\" the newspaper reported.\n\n\"Lebryk had a dispute with Musk's surrogates over access to the payment system the US government uses to disburse trillions of dollars every year... Officials affiliated with Musk's 'Department of Government Efficiency' have been asking since after the election for access to the system,\" and those requests \"were reiterated more recently, including after Trump's inauguration,\" the Post reported.\n\nWe asked for comment from the Treasury Department and DOGE today and will update this article if we get any response.\n\nSystem run by “small number of career officials”\n\nThe Post said it was \"unclear precisely why Musk's team sought access to those systems.\" But when Trump announced the creation of DOGE in November, he said it would \"pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"\n\nThe Treasury payment systems, run by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, are usually controlled by \"only a small number of career officials,\" the Post wrote. The Fiscal Service collects and disburses trillions of dollars. In the email announcing his retirement, Lebryk told the department's staff, \"Our work may be unknown to most of the public, but that doesn't mean it isn't exceptionally important.\"\n\nMark Mazur, who was a Treasury official during the Obama and Biden administrations, told the Post that the payment systems shouldn't be used for political purposes.\n\n\"This is a mechanical job—they pay Social Security benefits, they pay vendors, whatever. It's not one where there's a role for nonmechanical things, at least from the career standpoint. Your whole job is to pay the bills as they're due,\" Mazur was quoted as saying. \"It's never been used in a way to execute a partisan agenda… You have to really put bad intentions in place for that to be the case.\"\n\nThe Trump administration previously issued an order to freeze funding for a wide range of government programs, but rescinded the order after two days of protest and a judge's ruling that temporarily blocked the funding freeze.\nTrump ordered cooperation with DOGE\n\nThe Trump executive order establishing DOGE took the existing United States Digital Service and renamed it the United States DOGE Service. It's part of the Executive Office of the President and is tasked with \"modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.\"\n\nTrump's order said that federal agencies will have to collaborate with DOGE. \"Among other things, the USDS Administrator shall work with Agency Heads to promote inter-operability between agency networks and systems, ensure data integrity, and facilitate responsible data collection and synchronization,\" the order said. \"Agency Heads shall take all necessary steps, in coordination with the USDS Administrator and to the maximum extent consistent with law, to ensure USDS has full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems. USDS shall adhere to rigorous data protection standards.\"\n\nThe Post writes that \"Musk has sought to exert sweeping control over the inner workings of the US government, installing longtime surrogates at several agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, which essentially handles federal human resources, and the General Services Administration.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Musk visited the General Services Administration headquarters in Washington, DC, The New York Times reported. The Department of Government Efficiency's account on X stated earlier this week that the GSA had \"terminated three leases of mostly empty office space\" for a savings of $1.6 million and that more cuts are planned. In another post, DOGE claimed it \"is saving the Federal Government approx. $1 billion/day, mostly from stopping the hiring of people into unnecessary positions, deletion of DEI and stopping improper payments to foreign organizations, all consistent with the President's Executive Orders.\"\n\n\"Mr. Musk's visit to the General Services Administration could presage more cost-cutting efforts focused on federal real estate,\" the Times wrote. \"The agency also plays a role in federal contracting and in providing technology services across the federal government.\"\n\n(Edited due to formatting issue)",

The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed.

They also point to a high risk of miscommunication and escalation as Trump’s aggression collides with an affronted Panamanian elite.\n\nBalladares, sipping on iced coffee, argued that in an increasingly multipolar world, Trump is overplaying his hand. Fresh from a consultation at the presidential palace with his incumbent successor, José Raúl Mulino, Balladares said the only specific response they discussed was an appeal to the United Nations, which has since been made.\n\nBut Balladares raised the prospect that, if pushed, Panama could retaliate by opening up the choke points of another important flow: that of South American migrants heading north from Colombia.\n\n“One of the things that we might do, if, you know, if things become worse,” Balladares said, “is just open up the gates.”\nTense Exchanges\n\nRubio’s visit is set to test whether direct, high-level diplomacy can contain a crisis that began with threats made by Trump on social media late last year — alongside complaints about toll prices and claims that Chinese soldiers operate the canal — and escalated since.\n\nIn public and private, Panamanians have protested the lack of factual basis for Trump’s claims about a Chinese military presence, pointed out that transit fees are uniform and dictated by law and appealed to the authority of multilateral institutions.\n\nPeople who have worked for Trump and are privy to the Panamanian response offer a familiar take: Mulino’s administration is taking Trump’s belligerent gripes literally when it should instead take the underlying message — don’t forget it’s the U.S. that built and defends the canal — seriously.\n\nInitial diplomatic exchanges have not yielded any resolution, according to the participant.\n\nTalks between Claver-Carone and Panamanian officials — including cabinet ministers and Ambassador to the U.S. José Healy — began in the waning days of the Biden administration, the person said.\n\nIn the course of those exchanges, Panamanian officials have fact-checked Trump’s claims and cited Luis Almagro, secretary-general of the Organization of American States, a U.N.-type body for the Western Hemisphere. Almagro posted in December on X, “We expect the fullest and unrestricted compliance with the Agreements signed, approved and in force between the two countries.”\n\nThe message back from Claver-Carone has amounted to, “I don’t care what the secretary-general of OAS says, I don’t care what some columnist says. ... Do you think that we give a shit?” according to the person.\n\nA spokesperson for the Panamanian embassy in Washington, Siria Miranda, said she was unable to substantiate this account. The State Department’s press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSo far, one concession has been forthcoming: On the day of Trump’s inauguration, Panamanian government auditors descended on two ports, located at each end of the canal, operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings. But the deployment of auditors to scrutinize the company’s compliance with its port concession agreements did not contain the crisis.\n\nIn his inaugural address on the same day, Trump vowed to “take back” the canal, which the U.S. handed over to Panama in 1999. Mulino responded with a complaint to the U.N. Security Council that cited Panama’s rights under international law. This week, the Panamanian president reiterated his stance that control of the canal is not up for negotiation.\n\nIn the lead up to Rubio’s arrival, though, came a signal that the Trump administration is ready to temper its approach.\n\n“I think it’s clear this is an issue about developing a relationship,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told Fox Business on Tuesday. “Not about bossing other nations around, but making it clear that a partnership with the United States is something that they can trust, something that comes with benefits just like any good relationship does.”\n‘China Was Everywhere’\n\nWith or without Trump’s threats, China’s presence here has become a sticking point in U.S.-Panama relations as Beijing has made significant inroads into Latin America over the past decade-plus.\n\nMany American critics who recoil at the American president’s rhetoric agree that the U.S. could do more to roll back Chinese encroachment in Latin America.\n\nPanamanian elites, on the other hand, are loath to step back from a lucrative trading partner whose presence they argue poses no real threat to American security interests.\n\nPanama’s small Chinese community — roughly 4 percent of the country’s 4.5 million inhabitants — traces its roots in the 19th century and the arrival of laborers who came to help build the railroad, then the canal, that cross the isthmus.\n\nToday, Chinese culture remains a minor but visible presence in the life of the capital.\n\nIn January, a popular park named for the late dictator Omar Torrijos — who negotiated the handover of the canal from Jimmy Carter — was decked out for the impending Chinese lunar new year. As a diplomatic crisis embroiled the city, families strolled through traditional ornamental gateways and past a cartoonish panda luxuriating in a teacup.\n\nAmerican concerns about Chinese encroachment here date back at least to the 1990s, and the awarding of a contract to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong-based firm, to operate a port at the canal. Hutchison won the concession despite a last-minute bid by Virginia-based Bechtel and interest from other American contractors.\n\nAfterward, conservatives in the U.S. began to raise the alarm about “Red China” gaining control of the canal via Hutchison, but the uproar was widely interpreted in Panama as sour grapes over the bidding outcome.\n\nChina’s next major round of advances here came during the presidency of Juan Carlos Varela, which saw Panama cut ties with Taiwan and switch its recognition to Beijing in 2017.\n\nA series of diplomatic and investment deals promptly followed.\n\nAmong the most striking signs of China’s growing presence were plans that emerged for a new Chinese embassy to be built on the Amador Peninsula, which juts out from the city into the Pacific Ocean. The plans would have allowed the raising of a Chinese flag on high ground overlooking the entrance to the canal.\n\n“All of sudden it just looked like China was everywhere in Panama” said Robert Evan Ellis, a professor of Latin American Studies at the U.S. Army War College.\n\nChina’s headway here was smoothed by its then-Ambassador Wei Qiang, who made himself a visible presence in the life of the capital. Wei, a fluent Spanish speaker, had a taste for Armani suits and other fine clothing that earned him the nickname “the tailor of Panama” in some quarters.\n\nFor much of the time that Wei was charming his way through the city, he had no American counterpart. The 2018 resignation of U.S. Ambassador John Feeley, who cited irreconcilable differences with Trump, left a vacuum that was not filled for more than four years.\n\nBut U.S. pressure and dwindling domestic enthusiasm eventually blunted Chinese progress.\n\nPlans for the embassy were scrapped in 2018 in the face of American pushback, and the momentum of Chinese-Panamanian relations seemed to reverse after Varela left office in 2019.\n\nA Chinese company’s proposal to build a high-speed rail line from Panama City to the northern city of David stalled under Varela’s successor, Laurentino Cortizo, whose government also revoked a port concession that had been awarded to a Chinese firm.\n\nLast March, Beijing appointed a new ambassador, Xu Xueyuan, who does not speak fluent Spanish and has been less outgoing than her predecessor. The Chinese embassy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe personnel change was seen here, Ellis said, as “China’s downgrading of the relationship and downgrading their expectations of what was possible.”\n‘Typical New Yorker Bull’\n\nThe rolling back of China’s reach under Cortizo is just one reason that Panamanian leaders feel blindsided by Trump.\n\n**(Continued)**",

This includes cutting access to important social programs as well.\n\nVought has also been criticized for his stance on impoundment, arguing against the Impoundment Control Act and in favor of giving Trump the unilateral authority to control the budget and withhold and cancel funding to government programs and priorities that don't align with the Republican party's policies.\n\nVought has supported other Project 2025 policies as well, like criminalizing pornography and eliminating the Department of Education.\n\nVought is just another example of the rampant cronyism and conflicts of interest that are plaguing Trump's new administration.\n\nTrump has already nominated several Project 2025 and Heritage-linked allies to positions of power within his administration. Their agenda to establish a unitary executive has already been set in motion.\n\nThe goal will be to consolidate power and concentrate as much of it as possible in the hands of the president. \n\nThis will allow them to exploit the unchecked authority of the Trump executive to cripple the independence of most government agencies, especially regulatory agencies, stripping protections from civil servants and giving the Trump administration the power to \"purge\" these agencies of all federal staff members who are not loyal to him, while his admin may take steps to eliminate some of these agencies altogether.\n\nThis agenda will undermine the autonomy of most administrative agencies and organizations. It will only be a matter of time until Republicans begin installing MAGA loyalists into positions of power once reserved for those non-partisan civil servants and educated staff members whose job security didn't previously depend on their level of allegiance to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement.

          "It is by design\n\n*Largely copy and pasted from another user's comment\n\nReminder that this is out of Curtis Yarvins playbook to overthrow democracy and make America a Monarchy:\n\n[\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. **Run on the idea and win with a mandate from the people** (Trump did this, minus the mandate - but hes trying to claim he has the mandate)\n2. **Purge the bureacracy quickly so that people cannot react, give them pensions and severance packages so that they dont complain or push back.** As part of this Yarvin proposes taking over the Fed by appointing lackeys to run it, and defunding the bureacracy and govt agencies to essentially force federal agencies to cease existing (trying to do this as we speak, though it seems to be going slower than hed like, in part because our founding fathers infinite wisdom it takes time to install the political appointees needed to do the dirty work quickly. Likewise, the resign for severance scheme probably wont work, because its not really a deal Trunp can offer. Also his EO led to confusion more than it did a cessation of functioning of our government system and the courts have basically gummed that up for him at least for now. Jerome Powell is also ruining the Fed angle, as its not changing fiscal policy in response to Trumps demands and Jerome Powell is resisting Trumps authority to try to maintain the Feds independence, the clock is ticking though as he leaves office in 2026 and can be replaced then.)\n3. **Ignore the courts** \n4. **Co-opt Congress by filling it with yes men** (so far so good for Trump, though Trumps majority is too narrow to safely guarantee his protection and not everyone is an absolute loyalist and several have demonstrated willingness to break on specific issues so its tenuous)\n5. **Centralize police and government powers by implementing a state of emergency to take direct control of law enforcement authorities, federalize the national guard, and create a national police force** (theres no practical mechanism by which Trump can fo that, but it doesnt mean he wont try. Hes already using the national emergency rhetoric and is deploying military forces for law enfircement duties at the border, this will lower the bar of resistance for him if he tries to expand that into other areas of geography and responsibility. The rational next step for him would be to expand that deployment into the 100 mile border enforcement zone that rings the entire united states and which encompasses the core of blue America).\n6. **Shut down \"elite\" media and academic institutions and replace it with new - Yarvin says the Harvards and New York Times of the world need to be gone by April** (so, this will be hard to pull off, but at this stage Trump kinda doesnt have to - hes effectively co-opted twitter, tiktok, facebook, WaPo, Fix, etc. Hes inviting \"new media\" into the white house press room to undermine traditional legacy/mainstream media. His canceled funding impoundment EO would have possibly forced some academic institutions to shut down, but could have also been an attempt to co-opt them and force them into line. Going after NPR and PBS undermines the existence of a free and impartial media, they arent run by billionaires that can be bought so the only way to get rid of them is to defund them and put them out of business).\n7. **Turn out mobs of supporters in peaceful demonstration in support of regime change**",

According to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday granted Elon Musk and his minions at the faux-agency DOGE full access to the Treasury’s massive federal payment system. As with the rest of Musk’s wide-reaching project within the U.S. government under Donald Trump, it’s not at all clear what he plans to do with this unprecedented access.  \n...  \nThe report doesn’t specific who might be doing that monitoring; the Treasury Department’s inspector general was one of the 15 independent agency watchdogs the Trump White House purged a week ago.\n\n>So now Musk and DOGE have access to and potentially power over what is basically America’s checkbook, weeks before another debt ceiling crisis looms, at a time when Musk is vowing to somehow cut a hysterically large amount of federal spending, and during a chaotic period in which he and other officials in the Trump administration are running roughshod across the federal government like they have unchecked power.

Brown**\n\n**The Atlantic, January 31 2025**\n\nIn the past two weeks, the Trump administration has spent a remarkable amount of time undoing health orders—not just the Biden administration’s rules, but also its own jarring crackdown.\n\nOn day two of Donald Trump’s presidency, the White House ordered a freeze on communications from federal health agencies. The government’s medical-research agency, the National Institutes of Health, devolved into chaos; many employees wondered whether they could continue with basic functions of their job, such as attending scientific meetings and reviewing grants. Days later, a new memo clarified that they could continue their work, but not say anything about it to the public.\n\nThis week, after the White House budget office released a memo ordering a freeze on trillions of dollars in federal grants and loans, state Medicaid agencies, hospitals, and community centers were unsure if they could continue operating. The administration had said the freeze would not affect Medicaid, but state administrators were locked out of the federal-funding portal. Soon, states regained access, a judge temporarily blocked the order, and the administration rescinded the memo. (Trump’s orders requiring government agencies to eliminate spending on “woke” ideologies remain in effect.)\n\nAmid all that scrambling, the administration also ordered a pause on international aid, which led health organizations to stop distributing HIV medications purchased with U.S. funds, only to have the State Department walk back that directive. But even after the reversal, clinics remained closed.\n\nIt’s all a lot to follow, to say the least. In some of its endeavors, the Trump administration does appear to have a clear set of goals: to overwhelm the opposition and seize power for the executive branch. But so far, the president’s strategy for restoring America to an imagined healthier version of itself seems to consist of no strategy at all. Previously, Trump had suggested that his policies would be whatever Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, wanted—“I’m going to let him go wild on health,” Trump said at a rally in October. And yet, during his confirmation hearings this week, Kennedy repeatedly deferred to Trump. He elaborated his thoughts on regenerative agriculture (which would not fall under his purview at the Department of Health and Human Services), but when quizzed on hot-button issues such as the abortion drug mifepristone (which would), he parroted the party line. “I will implement President Trump’s policies,” Kennedy said.\n\n\nThe changes that have stuck (so far) are a hodgepodge of policies, and appear more focused on getting rid of ideas and initiatives the president doesn’t like than on fixing the problems of cost and access that pervade America’s health-care ecosystem. Trump issued an executive order requiring that the federal government recognize only two sexes, despite decades of biological research showing that sex is far more complex. He reinstated thousands of service members who were kicked out of the military for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine at the height of the pandemic. He pulled America out of the World Health Organization because, as Trump put it, it’s a rip-off. He reversed key Affordable Care Act elements introduced by Joe Biden that extended enrollment periods, reaffirmed coverage for preexisting conditions, and aimed to lower premiums. He revoked two Biden-administration executive orders that sought to protect access to abortion in the U.S., made plans to rejoin an international anti-abortion pact, and reinstated a ban on funding for overseas nongovernmental organizations that perform or promote abortions—despite election-cycle promises to leave abortion to the states.\n\nTrump is also derailing projects he previously indicated he might like. Even though he has long supported drug-pricing reforms, he rescinded a Biden executive order that created three new drug-pricing models to lower the cost of prescription drugs for people on Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nA decision on Kennedy’s confirmation is expected as soon as next week. If he takes control of the administration’s health-care strategy, its actions might start to look more coordinated. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy emphasized his desire to combat chronic diseases, suggesting that federal health research should aim to “identify the toxins that are contributing to chronic disease and eliminate them.” Chronic diseases are the leading cause of illness, disability, and death in America, though their causes go far beyond toxins in food and the environment.\n\nIn other areas of health policy, though, the flailing may continue. Kennedy appeared disinterested and at times confused when senators asked him about Medicare and Medicaid, which account for the majority of HHS’s budget. Kennedy has also spent decades spreading misinformation about the alleged harms of vaccines, but he told lawmakers at the first hearing that vaccines play a “critical” role in health care, that he supports the childhood-immunization schedule, and that he would not delay or alter how the Food and Drug Administration reviews vaccines. Perhaps the most telling exchange happened on the second day, when Senator Bill Cassidy, a doctor and Louisiana Republican, asked Kennedy whether he planned to reassure parents that vaccines for hepatitis B and measles do not cause autism. “If the data is there, I will absolutely do that,” Kennedy responded. But the data is there. Mountains of it, for decades. Such a basic disregard for scientific inquiry would make Kennedy fundamentally unpredictable as the head of American health.\n\nThe Trump administration’s present strategy has plunged much of the government’s health-care apparatus into disarray. The FDA is scrubbing mentions of diversity from its website, leaving researchers uncertain about whether they can still attempt to include diverse populations in clinical trials. Government scientists, as well as hospitals and other health-care providers that receive federal money, still don’t know how funding changes will affect their work. A system outage has left the National Science Foundation unable to pay researchers. The administration may well have plans for drug-pricing reforms and health farms in the works. But through all this chaos, it’s hard to see Trump’s vision for a healthier America.",

          "ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS a very bad president who caused much harm to his country’s democracy. Even before he became president, he was credibly accused of theft, fraud, and sexual assault, but people thought he was entertaining and supported him anyway.\n\nAs president, he used the government to enrich himself and his cronies. He elevated corrupt incompetents who drove institutions into the ground. His once-proud political party—cowed by his fanatical, tribal following—tolerated him for too long.\n\nHe attacked his own party, the free press, government officials, the judiciary, and anyone who tried to keep him accountable, eroding public trust in democracy itself.\n\nNo, I’m not talking about Donald Trump, but rather his wily South African analog, Jacob Zuma, whose tenure as president from 2009 to 2018 presented an existential threat to the continent’s most solid democracy. \n\nThe two men’s uncanny similarities made for some uncomfortable moments when I briefed Trump officials on Zuma during their overlapping terms.\n\nThere are some personal differences, of course. Zuma, with his second-grade education, is by far the more intelligent and accomplished. He was born into poverty and suffered for his country, serving time in Robben Island prison with Nelson Mandela for his role in the anti-apartheid struggle.\n\nAlso, Zuma is married to most of his wives simultaneously. He’s been married six times and currently has four wives and twenty-three children (not all of them with his wives). Unlike Trump, Zuma was criminally prosecuted (but acquitted) for rape.\n\nThe alleged victim was his friend’s HIV-positive daughter, whom Zuma had known since she was a child. He claimed the encounter was consensual and a post-coital shower compensated for the unprotected sex.\n\nBut the main divergence of the Zuma and Trump stories is that South Africa’s democracy—just thirty years old—has responded better to its authoritarian threat than the world’s oldest, richest, most powerful democracy.\n\n⏬ Bluesky article thread (15 min) with extra links 📖🍿🔊\n\n[",

          "This situation exhibits several characteristics associated with fascism, including:\n\nAuthoritarian Control Over Government Institutions – The reported locking out of career civil servants from key government data systems at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) consolidates power within a small group of politically aligned individuals. This mirrors fascist tactics where bureaucratic institutions are reshaped to serve the ruling party's agenda rather than functioning independently.\n\nElimination of Oversight and Transparency – The article notes that Musk’s team has restricted access to databases without oversight, making it difficult for anyone outside their inner circle to monitor what is happening. A lack of transparency and independent oversight is a key feature of authoritarian regimes, allowing for potential abuses of power.\n\nLoyalty Over Meritocracy – The swift removal of career officials, the sidelining of OPM’s chief management officer, and the installation of Musk’s close associates in key positions suggest a shift from a merit-based civil service to a system that prioritizes political loyalty. Fascist movements often dismantle existing bureaucracies and replace them with loyalists to ensure ideological control.\n\nDismantling Institutional Safeguards – By restricting access to federal employment data and controlling who can interact with critical government systems, Musk’s team is bypassing long-standing institutional safeguards. This aligns with fascist strategies where independent government agencies are neutralized to prevent them from acting as checks on executive power.\n\nCorporate Influence Over the State – The presence of Musk’s former employees and executives from his private companies taking control of federal agencies indicates a fusion of corporate and state power. Historically, fascist regimes have relied on close relationships with business elites to implement their agendas while suppressing democratic institutions.\n\nMilitarization of Workplace Culture – The installation of sofa beds for around-the-clock work reflects an extreme work culture that Musk has enforced at his private companies, now being imposed on a government agency. Fascist regimes often glorify a militarized work ethic, emphasizing sacrifice and total devotion to the state or its leaders.\n\nPsychological Coercion and Forced Attrition – The memos encouraging federal workers to take buyouts and leave, framed in an unusually casual tone, suggest an effort to pressure employees to quit rather than outright firing them. This kind of coercion aligns with fascist tactics of purging institutions of those who might resist authoritarian changes.\n\nTechno-Authoritarianism – The use of technology to centralize control over government functions without oversight mirrors broader concerns about the role of Big Tech in governance. A government where private tech elites exert direct control over federal systems creates a pathway for surveillance, manipulation, and the erosion of democratic accountability.\n\nThese elements suggest a shift toward authoritarian governance with fascist tendencies, where democratic institutions are being eroded in favor of centralized, loyalist control backed by corporate power.",

          "DEI= Don and Elon's Incompetence",
          "It's a good thing the official reports say 9/11 happened due to delays in appointees and the lack of communication that resulted; aka, indirect incompetence.  \nI'm sure it'll be fine this time though.",
          "No, it didn't. It brought to light what gutting staff and anti-DEI policies does to reality. \n\nDo not sanewash this avoidable bullshit. When DT cuts, the people die.",
          "Trump once told his nephew that his disabled son “should be allowed to die”",
          "You can put whatever words together you want as a security blanket, I'm still not going to coddle you.",
          "But we already know the root cause - DEI. Therefore, it's Biden and Obama to blame. \n\n/s just in case",
          "Also a big thanks to the Trump admin for the hiring freeze of air traffic controllers.\n\n[",
          "While this plane crash might not have been the result this time. Next time it definetly will. Safeguards are there for a reason. They are written in blood. You start to remove them? Accidents become more common. Do not be surprised when aviation accidents become more common.",
          "Make no mistake.  This has nothing to do with where the crash is and everything to do with him not giving a shit.",
          "Also disbanded a key aviation security group in his efforts to end DEI initiatives. Also fired the heads of the TSA and Coast Guard.",
          "Mango unchained probably thinks the black box is a diversity hire.",
          "And the whole anti-DEI movement is that if the person isn’t 100% healthy Anglo Saxon male, then that person is subhuman and mentally inferior and incapable of performing the most complex and important jobs. In reality though, DEI actually ensures the most competent people get whatever job it is because it recognizes that racism, sexism, and discrimination does indeed exist and it prevents idiot white dudes from getting all the jobs and promotions that a more qualified “DEI” person deserves.",
          "> DEI cancer.\n\nPhew.  You can smell the brainrot.",
          "So, if you are a visible minority of any type, or a woman, it's going to be assumed that you got the job because of DEI instead of merit. What a disaster.",
          "I am no expert, but the air traffic controller told the helicopter pilot multiple times about the incoming plane. And the helicopter pilot confirmed that he had it in sight. The air traffic controller appears to have done his job as expected. I suspect that the helicopter pilot had a different plane in sight, and was unaware of the one that they ended up colliding with.

Last week, specialist aviation site The Air Current reported that industry veteran Chris Rocheleau had been sworn in as deputy FAA administrator, which would put him in acting charge of the agency. The Wall Street Journal had first reported that he would become deputy.\n> \n> Whitaker’s departure came after he clashed with Musk, who is now in charge not just of SpaceX but of the Department of Government Efficiency.\n> \n> In September Whitaker had proposed fines of more than $600,000 for SpaceX, prompting Musk to demand his resignation and promise to sue.\n> \n> Whitaker, Space.com reported in September, told a Congressional committee that the fines were “the only tool we have to get compliance on safety matters.”\n> \n> But Musk had kept up the attacks on X, at a time when he was campaigning at Trump’s side. On Sept. 17 he accused Whitaker’s agency of harassment, posting, “The FAA space division is harassing SpaceX about nonsense that doesn’t affect safety while giving a free pass to Boeing even after NASA concluded that their spacecraft was not safe enough to bring back the astronauts.”\n> \n> And in a reply to a tweet by an Australian YouTuber who posts videos about space and who has said the FAA “should not exist,” Musk accused Whitaker of standing in the way of his vision of putting human life on Mars.\n> \n> “The fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!” he tweeted at Marcus House.\n> \n> Whitaker had offered no insight into why he decided to leave the post before the end of his five-year term in 2028.\n> \n> “The United States is the safest and most complex airspace in the world, and that is because of your commitment to the safety of the flying public,” Whitaker wrote in an email sent to staff at the FAA when he quit in December. He called his time at the federal agency “the best and most challenging job of my career.”\n> \n> FAA administrators typically serve a five-year term, but an administrator stepping down before the end of that term is not unheard of. Stephen Dickson, Whitaker’s Trump-appointed predecessor, resigned in 2022—just under three years after taking office in 2019.\n> \n> The troubled agency has long struggled to have proper leadership. Whitaker was confirmed 98-0 by senators in October 2023, after a stand-off between Republicans and the White House over Joe Biden’s first pick, Joe Washington.\n> \n> Acting boss Rocheleau now faces a massive crisis for the FAA. Its air traffic controllers are responsible for the safe movement of civilian aircraft and will be investigated to understand how a UH-60 Army Black Hawk could fly into an American Airlines regional jet which was about to land on one of the country’s busiest runways.\n> \n> The FAA had already been wrestling with persistent shortages of air traffic controllers. And this week, air traffic controllers were included in the Trump administration’s offer of buyouts to all federal workers.\n> \n> The investigation into the crash will be led by the independent National Transportation Safety Board, which is chaired by Jennifer Homendy.

          "David Graham: “In the middle of the night, as news about the plane crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was breaking, Trump posted on Truth Social: [\n\n>‘The airplane was on a perfect and routine line of approach to the airport. The helicopter was going straight at the airplane for an extended period of time. It is a CLEAR NIGHT, the lights on the plane were blazing, why didn’t the helicopter go up or down, or turn. Why didn’t the control tower tell the helicopter what to do instead of asking if they saw the plane. This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!’\n\n“He raises some valid points—ones that many people might be wondering about themselves. The difference between them and him is that he is the leader of the federal government, able to marshal unparalleled resources to get answers about a horror that happened just two and a half miles from his home. He’s the commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces, and the crash involved an Army helicopter. But Trump isn’t really interested in doing things. Like Chauncey Gardiner, the simple-minded protagonist of ‘Being There,’ he likes to watch.\n\n“This morning, Trump held an astonishing briefing at the White House where he and his aides unspooled racist speculation, suggesting (without any evidence) that underqualified workers hired under DEI programs had caused the accident. ‘We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong ideas and opinions, and I think we’ll state those opinions now,’ Trump said, and he did. Vice President J. D. Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth criticized diversity efforts from the lectern as well. (Trump also misrepresented Federal Aviation Administration programs.) Trump insisted that he wasn’t getting ahead of the investigation by speculating, and that he could tell diversity was to blame because of ‘common sense.’ Trump also paused to accuse former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg of “bullshit,” and narrated videos and information he’d seen in the news, interspersing his personal observations as a helicopter owner and passenger.\n\n“…The pilots, DEI, air-traffic controllers, Buttigieg—the only common thread appeared to be that everyone was to blame, except for Trump himself.\n\n“No one could reasonably hold Trump responsible for the crash, just 10 days into his term—though that is the bar he has often tried to set. ‘I alone can fix it,’ he has assured Americans, telling them that he personally can master and control the government in a way no one else can. He promised to be a dictator, though only on day one. Yet even while discounting his bluster, it would be nice to see the president doing something more than watching cable news and posting about it … Though exasperating, this passivity is no surprise. It was a running theme of Trump’s first administration and is already back in the second.”\n\nRead more: [",

[Archive link here]( [Original link here](\n\nUnder Mr. Trump in April 2019, the F.A.A. announced a pilot program for 20 people with targeted disabilities to work in air traffic operations. Targeted disabilities are a set of statutorily defined disabilities, including, but not limited to, those cited by Mr. Trump, that the federal government emphasizes for recruiting. An [archived page from June 2019](  named the initiative the Aviation Development Program, which “provides an opportunity for persons with targeted disabilities to gain aviation knowledge and experience as an air traffic control student trainee.”\n\n**“The candidates in this program will receive the same rigorous consideration in terms of aptitude, medical and security qualifications as those individuals considered for a standard public opening for air traffic controller jobs,”** the F.A.A. said in 2019. Those standards include passing an air traffic skills assessment and a medical exam.\n\n\nAccording to [a Medium post from the agency]( one of the program’s first three candidates graduated in 2021 from the F.A.A. Academy and became an air traffic controller trainee that year. It is unclear how many people who graduated from that program are air traffic controllers today.\n\n**Moreover, experts said they could not cite a known instance of a plane crash in which diversity efforts had been cited as the sole cause.**\n\n“Historically, there has never been an incident, big or small, where D.E.I. or diversity has ever been attributed as a sole cause or contributing cause,” said Tennessee Garvey, a pilot and the chairman of the board of directors for the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals.\n\n**He added that the rigorous standards for hiring pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers were never relaxed to meet diversity goals**, but rather that previous administrations and the commercial air industry overall have worked to remove barriers to entry.\n\nHis actions are nothing more than an attempt to rewrite history to distance himself from his adminstrations own decisions because he knows [the shit heads]( he [associates]( with are going to point out these policies and he needs to distance himself from them while placing blame on a group of people who in no way had anything to do with this horrific accident. The [shortage]( of air traffic controllers has been a years long issue and while the [FFA]( has made a lot of progress recently the [timeline]( to go from a new hire starting at the academy to becoming a fully certified professional controller (CPC) usually ranges from 6 months to 5 years depending on the individual candidate’s background and where they are stationed.

Yet in his briefing-room appearance yesterday, “Trump repeatedly implied that the crash was the fault of his Democratic predecessors and of DEI policies. Trump offered no evidence to support his claims but repeatedly cast the blame on others, even as bodies were still being pulled from the frigid waters of the Potomac River just a few miles away.”\n\n“Similarly freewheeling question-and-answer sessions became the hallmark of Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, with Trump performing for the cameras—often for more than an hour at a time—and exuding the bravado of someone who believed that he alone could steer the nation through the greatest public-health crisis in a century,” Lemire continues. “But instead of being reassuring, fact-based public-service announcements, the briefings were defined by falsehoods, politicization, and outlandish recommendations to inject disinfectant. Those nightly battles, Trump’s closest aides believe, helped seal his defeat in the 2020 election … By the time he finally abandoned the briefings, he trailed Joe Biden by six points in the polls.\n\n“Both \\[Defense Secretary Pete\\] Hegseth, a former Fox News host, and \\[Transportation Secretary Sean\\] Duffy, once a reality-TV star, have significant experience in front of the cameras,” Lemire writes. “But a White House official told me that there was never a question that Trump himself would brief the press after the crash.”\n\nRead more: [",

Going \"well, other people are racist/anti-Semitic too!!!!\" is not the strong argument you think it is. Nazis are Nazis and they deserve to be called out for it and given absolutely no quarter. Nazis do not deserve safety or sympathy. That includes Nazi sympathizers. Decent people should drive them out and show them that they are not welcome in modern society and given everything you just said? I'm confident that includes you.",

          "It’s literally insane that we are about to live through a trade war with Canada…an ally and literal neighboring country. The USA is speed running completely tanking its reputation in record time.",

          "No. Trump is just a bully. He thinks by crippling Canada he can use that to get concessions. He is a toxic narcissist who only knows how to terrorize others and cannot treat anyone with respect - because he is insecure and lacks self confidence, and pretends to be a touch guy.",
          "It doesn't matter if Canada is or isn't. Truth is now nothing more than a shared opinion.\n\nWe've all been sucked into a senile old man's fever dream. We all experience his nightmare firsthand while some of our friends and family walk toward the sickening, fetid, orange glow with spiraling eyes, chanting for more.\n\n\"Hurt them, daddy. Hurt the ones not like us.\"\n\nThe passive are still heard yelling from their hiding spots: \n\n\"Don't blame us! It makes no difference! They're all the same!\" \n\nIt masks the knowledge that they damned us and themselves with inaction.\n\nReality is no longer real. They warned us the first time with 'Alternative Facts'. We now watch the madness take hold.",

          "As a Canadian, the Americans are now as much allies as the Russians and the Chinese. It is an indescribable disappointment and the damage will be for generations. Not only will it lead us into a serious recession but you will pay a high price too. Why having enemies when you have the USA as an ally.",
          "4D chess move: \n\nCanada joins the US as the 51st state.  With 2 new senators and 50+ new house representative and electoral votes, they turn the tide of US politics, usher in a new golden age of American leadership, and then secede back into their own country.  Thus saving Western democracy.",

In short, we hate you. \n\nThe American people's apathy, nihilism, and frank arrogance have enabled the rise of your Shitlord-in-Chief. Your country is being ripped apart at the federal level by a techbro run amok. You are doing nothing! Your experiment, which was the envy of the free world, is being torn apart to create little tech feifdoms with tech bro billionaires as the leaders. Trump is their CEO and they are the Board. This comes from a guy named Curtis Yarvin via podcasts and blogs. Go on...check for yourself. Don't just believe a random pissed off Canadian. \n\nIf you want to save your country, get into the streets, riot, protest, and fight for your democracy or you are going to lose it. This is the MAGA end state...they want you to give up.  \n\nIn this trade war, if you are still a good human being, buy Canadian or Mexican. Vacation in Canada or Mexico.

If we go to war with Canada, I hope Canada will accept defectors into their ranks because I'm sure a huge portion of our country would be inclined to fight back with you. Fuck this fascist traitor. I'm sorry we are being the worst neighbors right now. You guys have always been an amazing ally and not all Americans have forgotten that.",
          "Canada contributes fairly to NATO, like many trumpers you seem to think trump is saying they do not. He is intentionally misrepresenting where Canada is lacking their payment to which is investment in your own military.",
          "Um, we can see how trump 'cherishes' the existing 50 states + plus their colonies like Puerto Rico who isn't even allowed to vote in elections.  \n\nWe want none of that in Canada thank you very much.",
          "Go Canada! Dish it back to them!\n\nNo country should back down and kowtow to Americans just because. If they have a problem with trade relations, they should talk about it and have a proper discussion with partners.\n\nUS President has disrespected Canada's sovereignty as a nation.",

          "Yup. Canadian here who knows the (proper) words for your anthem. Also pissed and disappointed. This is really dumb. Really, really dumb. Even a good chunk of the conservative subreddit is, in their own way, not thrilled by this.",

          "As a Canadian I am furious and not panicked at all. Fuck Trump. I hope we retaliate to the full extent.",

          "If he does this it may be because Canadians are beginning to unite against him while also moving against the conservative party of canada, and I'm sure Trump would prefer a conserative canada to a liberal one with carney at the helm",

Trying to look on the bright side of this dreadfully dismal situation.  \n\nHere's a genuine sore-ee for the trouble from a Yank suffering under an administration i do not support.  \n\nI suspect Trump will site some nonsense to claim victory and call it off but if not I look forward to a time where we treat our allies like allies and our rivals like rivals again.

          "Hope this disdain is openly visible to any Americans coming to Canada. It really is deserved for how y'all are treating your closest friends. I for one will not be going to the US till the doofus is out of office",

          "God damn right we will. Canadians have a lot of pride and we won't be walked over. As a Canadian, I'm already pissed off enough that I think we should go big in retaliation and stop selling all oil. I'm sure the USA oil companies would be up in arms and convince Trump to fold. If that doesn't work, we should just stop all export and close the boarder. What's the point of doing death by a thousand cuts when we can just challenge you to a duel.",

Ever since then the real powers behind our politicians have been moving towards killing democratic power for good in the US. They are very close to achieving that goal now.

What is happening now is an accelerationist form of that compressed into days not years.  Reagan and the GOP back then couldn’t act on Weyrich‘s plan to dismantle the government because the public had not yet been conditioned to believe it.  It took many decades of fake think tanks working with the mainstream media, GOP obstruction, Fox News brainwashing, and Koch network financed fake astroturf movements to get the public over to their side.  The writing was on the wall when Obama came into office.  By then, the dems had not mounted any kind of defense or counteroffensive, and let the society slowly get taken over.  I remember at the time, in the early 2000s, when democratic norms began to disappear due to the war on terror, virtually no democrats stood up to put a stop to it. I also remember how it took academics from outside the university system to even address the problem. You have to understand, the seditionists have infiltrated every major aspect of society, from the media to the universities to government.  This was the brainchild of the dominionists, who used the seven mountain mandate to merge supply side Jesus with capitalism. Progressives have been warning about this moment for a very long time.  Nobody did anything to prevent it.",
          "Trump and the republicans were given control of all three branches of government. So action is easy for them. \n\nDems have zero control of congress, don't have presidency, and what judges they have left are already doing their best to block trump (for now).",

          "According to the Brookings Institue:\n\nTariffs are unusual in that they are a tax that is not implemented by congressional legislation, and thus circumvent a potentially lengthy and deliberative journey through the House and Senate. Instead, tariffs are imposed by executive branch regulation—but unlike most federal regulations, tariffs avoid almost all the legislated guardrails, administrative procedures, and judicial reviews that apply to other executive regulations.\n\nThe executive branch has the authority to impose tariffs through two different processes. First, a series of Trade Acts—enacted between the 1930s and 1970s—empower the executive branch to proclaim tariff rates to protect American workers and consumers from unfair trade practices. This is the authority that empowered President Trump to impose limited tariffs on products like solar panels and washing machines during his first administration. To invoke this authority, an investigation is initiated by either the Department of Commerce or the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether tariffs are necessary to remedy unfair trade practices. These investigations take some minimal time—including a 30-60 day notice-and-comment period that allows the public an opportunity to raise concerns—meaning that these authorities cannot realistically be used to impose new tariffs on trading partners on day one.\n\nInstead, if President Trump wishes to impose tariffs more quickly, he will likely need to invoke the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Under the IEEA, Congress grants authority to the executive branch to address “unusual and extraordinary” peacetime threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy.\n\nUnlike tariffs enacted under the various trade acts, those imposed under the IEEPA bypass departmental reports, reviews, and public notice-and-comment periods. This streamlines implementation but bypasses essentially all regulatory checks and balances.\n\n[Would you like to know more](",

The political cost is asymmetric here. Trump has to actually gain something, the others just have to retaliate with their own tariffs and wait for this house of cards to fall down.

Therefore, the state did not mean for women to have any rights in the space it delegated them. Legal scholars have identified this lack of legal framework as contributing to women’s economic and physical insecurities. By situating political and legal institutions only in the public sphere, the state created a society where crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual assault are some of the least reported offences today. Historically, physical and sexual violence against women were considered a right reserved for men. Violence was normalized and not legally considered a form of abuse.\n\n>\n\nUS law has always put sexually assaulted women in a disadvantaged position. Republicans are making laws worse for women.\n\nRemember...\n\n>Because the existing power structure is built on female subjugation, female credibility is inherently dangerous to it. Patriarchy is called that for a reason: men really do benefit from it. When we take seriously women’s experiences of sexual violence and humiliation, men will be forced to lose a kind of freedom they often don’t even know they enjoy: the freedom to use women’s bodies to shore up their egos, convince themselves they are powerful and in control, or whatever other uses they see fit.

As much as I like Wikler, I resonated more with Martin’s intentions to undo the GOP ratfuck of individual states by putting actual resources behind state and local races.\n\nIt may be the best way we can harden the country against state collaborators. Maybe even more durable than just recapturing one of the chambers of Congress.",

          "> This is exactly why giving South Carolina, who will never ever vote for Dems and is not representative of the party, primacy in the primaries is beyond stupid.    \n        \nHonestly, the optics of that change were fucking **AWFUL**.     \n       \nBiden's campaign was off to a terrible start, SC basically turns it around for him completely and makes him the instant frontrunner... and then after he wins the DNC immediately turns around and makes SC the first state?  That sounds exactly like something that Trump would do.  It sounds 100% out of the Trump playbook.       \n         \nAnd it's even more ridiculous because SC is a hardcore red state.  (And demographically, my memory is Nevada is closer to matching US racial demographics AND is swing state).          \n         \nNow don't get me wrong, I also understand that having two of the whitest states in the nation being the first two primary states was also heavily problematic, and that some change was called for.  I'm not saying things should have stayed exactly how they were either.     \n       \nHonestly, I'm not sure having any one state go first is good, it seems to give too much power / not enough variety.  If we kept the same four starting states, I would do two at a time.  Something like having Iowa and SC start on the same day, then wait three weeks or whatever and do New Hampshire and Nevada at the same time.       \n        \nAlthough what I would probably like even more is for the first couple states to always be whatever the closest swing states the previous election were.  (Though I understand you might need a maximum size limit.  Like back when Florida was a swing state, that would probably be too tough for smaller candidates)",

They voted out the conservative DFL who controlled the entire farm bill and tilted it towards MN and replaced him with a drunk. Likewise years ago they voted out a guy who brought in 300 million of pork to the iron range for some idiot from Virginia who dipped back to the east coast.

          "Wrong.\n\nI work in an active duty shop of 33 ppl and TWO of us openly supported democracy.  The rest just spout maga garbage all day long about how republicans love the military and veterans and it's the democrats that want to reduce our pay and benefits.\n\nSo bad that the commander had to ban maga and Trump flags being flown on cars",

          "This is, in large part, why they ousted those Inspectors General. The goal the entire time has been to replace all positions of oversight. \n\nTrump and his MAGA coalition have made it clear that they believe they are beholden to no one. And what's worse, they feel solely entitled to power, control and government supervision, like they are *owed* these things...\n\nThis is just one of many steps they're taking towards single party rule... It's not a fucking \"joke.\" A much too large proportion of the American electorate simply dismissed Trump's threats, and along with the media, they played a hand in all but sane washing and normalizing this kind of corruption.\n\nEven then, the MAGA movement's most vocal followers will blindly defend these actions because they're under the impression that Trump is just \"draining the swamp,\" and that these kinds of bold, autocratic measures are \"merited,\" necessary, justified.\n\nYou imbeciles elected the swamp! Republicans have been putting these swamp monsters on the payroll!\n\nTrump says \"Golden age,\" I say *gilded age.*\n\nThis is the richest administration in US history, and filled to excess with billionaires and unqualified Trump loyalists, plutocrats and aspiring oligarchs, corporate cronies and rich conservative benefactors who are in bed with special interests. \n\nAnd all this time they are picking your pockets while distracting you from the rampant cronyism and corruption, because instead, your focus is on the culture wars and all the propaganda playing into your fears, your persecution complex, your grievances, your prejudices and contempt for all out-groups, marginalized persons and whatever scapegoat or boogeyman of the week is endangering *your* country.\n\nFor decades, Republicans have been pushing this messaging that says, in the simplest terms, government is only good when they are in power.\n\nSo then there's one chunk of the electorate, made up of low propensity voters, claiming that \"Trump doesn't really mean it,\" or \"he's not serious,\" but then there's another portion of voters, the MAGA diehards, who are cheering on these efforts because all they understand is that when their party is in control and taking steps to eliminate the opposition, checks and balances and dissenters within the government, it's well deserved. \n\nGovernment *bad,* independent regulatory agencies *bad,* oversight *bad,* accountability *bad* (unless of course it's Republicans who are carrying the stick).",

They don't feel pressured, or worried. They know the oligarchs will fund their campaigns, and the media will sandwich all they do \n\nI fear we've come to the point where things have to get much much worse for people to actively rise up against the oligarchs, and only a long, hard general strike, or literal constant riots will convince the oligarchs to give up an inch of power.",

They just don't like the morals and ethics side of anything. \n\nThe world will reshape without us and threats or tariffs will speed that up.",

MAGA did this to lay the ground work so they could go after their own enemies.\n\nit was all projection. It was all lies. The justice department under democrat leadership has been independent.

          "In her confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, senators repeatedly pressed Tulsi Gabbard on her highly scrutinized trip to Syria in 2017, where she met President Bashar al-Assad and others, including a Syrian cleric who had previously threatened to unleash suicide bombers in the United States if the American military intervened in his country.\n\nWhen asked by Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico) whether she was aware of the threat made by Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun, who was then Grand Mufti of Syria, Gabbard — President Donald Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence — answered: “I was not and had not heard that until today.”\n\nBut documents reviewed by The Washington Post indicate that Gabbard was aware of Hassoun’s threats soon after she returned from her controversial visit to the country in January 2017.\n\nThe documents, which [appear within a larger trove from Gabbard’s former congressional office]( show that Hassoun’s comments on suicide bombers were flagged as problematic by one of her aides in early 2017 and were identified in an external vetting process as the likeliest source of negative publicity about the trip.\n\nA Google account in Gabbard’s name left comments in an electronic draft of potential answers her office was preparing to counter anticipated media questions about the cleric.\n\nThe Post could not independently confirm whether Gabbard herself was using the account, but it was used to send emails to staff signed in her name and advisers sent messages to it that were addressed to Gabbard. A detailed log of the effort to prepare the post-trip paperwork compiled by a senior adviser attributed actions taken with the account to Gabbard herself.\n\nSpokespeople for Gabbard and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHassoun was appointed to the position of Grand Mufti, Syria’s most senior Sunni Muslim cleric, by the Assad regime in 2005. He was an Assad loyalist and, as the country descended into civil war, publicly warned Washington and other Western nations against taking military action against the government.\n\n“I say to all of Europe, I say to America, we will set up suicide bombers who are now in your countries, if you bomb Syria or Lebanon,” he said in a speech in September 2011, according to an [Associated Press report from the time]( “From now on, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”\n\nThe records reviewed by The Post show that when Gabbard was first invited to visit Syria by Ohio-based activists in November 2016, Hassoun was one of the dignitaries they said she would have the opportunity to meet. She eventually visited Syria, as well as Lebanon, the following January.\n\nAccording to her account of the trip, Gabbard had a meeting with Hassoun on the afternoon of Jan. 16, 2017, directly after she met Assad and his wife, Asma. It was not clear what they discussed.\n\nRead more here: [",

Over the 20 week growing season you'll receive a portion of whatever the farm produces on a weekly basis.  I'm in for produce, fruit and eggs.  I considered a meat share too but decided not to at this time.\n  \nA fair estimation on a weekly basis is a bushel of produce, a dozen eggs, and a varied amount and variety of fruit depending on what's coming in.",

          "Europe has its own grim record on islands like Lesbos in Greece, where migrants are housed in Moria, an official camp that looks like a prison. The squatter camp next door is even worse. I’ve been there. It’s terrible. But the refugees are sustained by the hope of a better future. If Trump presses ahead with mass deportations, the US is about to embark on a terrible experiment that will stain the nation.\n\nLocking people up and throwing away the key sounds tough, but the reality is dehumanising, not just for the prisoners but their jailers. Americans grew ashamed of the “forever wars” launched after 9/11, with the ghastly images of tortured prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq staining their self-image as liberators.\n\nOne person, though, seems immune from shame: Pete Hegseth, Trump’s new defence secretary. His former [alcoholism and alleged mistreatment of women was thoroughly covered]( during his Senate confirmation hearing, but far less attention was paid to his views on alleged war criminals.\n\nHegseth, a former national guardsman, argued US soldiers were up against jihadists in Afghanistan and Iraq who “fight like savages” and were too hampered by regulations. As a *Fox News* contributor, he campaigned for pardons for three convicted US soldiers, which Trump granted as president in 2019. Two of the pardons sought by Hegseth were opposed by the US military.\n\nHegseth also served in Guantanamo and knows it well. “Guantanamo Bay… is a perfect spot,” Hegseth told *Fox News* host Jesse Watters. “We don’t want illegal criminals in the United States, not a minute longer than they have to be. Move them off to Guantanamo Bay where they can be safely maintained until they are deported to their final location.”\n\nThe “final location” for the new prisoners is uncertain. Venezuela is refusing to take any of its citizens back and a few military flights a day to unwilling hosts like Columbia and Brazil won’t be enough to satisfy Trump.\n\nWith Hegseth in charge of deploying the military under emergency powers to assistant immigration officials, the US is in danger of creating a Latin American gulag.\n\nRead more: [",

The refugee agency then identifies and screens potential sponsors who can take custody of the teens and children — often close relatives living in the United States — to get them out of government shelters.\n\nThe office has long operated independently of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement out of concern that the minors’ undocumented family members and sponsors may not come forward to claim them, fearing arrest.\n\nA similar effort during President Donald Trump’s first term drew swift outrage from civil-liberties groups who said it forced children to stay in federal custody longer, and led to the arrests of immigrant adults who had no criminal histories.\n\nRead more here: [",

          ">One nonprofit organization said in a report on the facility that it began operations under the Reagan administration as a place to keep Cuban and Haitian refugees who were intercepted at sea. Several organizations and press reports say that function has persisted to the present day, but it's set up to hold just over a hundred people -- not tens of thousands.\n\nTo expand it to be that much you'd have to invade Cuba. I mean Cuba is already feeling invaded by G Bay now, they don't recognize it. So invade Cuba *more*.\n\n>Last year, The New York Times reported that the facility held just 37 migrants from 2020 to 2023 and, \"in the past decade, the number of families has been in the single digits.\"\n\nThe cruelty is the point.\n\n>A 2024 report from the International Refugee Assistance Project, or IRAP, said that migrants who ended up there \"are detained indefinitely in prison-like conditions without access to the outside world and trapped in a punitive system\" operated by the Department of Homeland Security, among other agencies \"with little to no transparency or accountability.\"\n\n>The group said that \"on United States soil, extensive laws, procedures, and rules govern adjudication and review of asylum decisions\" at the migrant center at Guantanamo Bay, but \"there is no known guidance about how asylum and refugee decisions are made or what standards are being applied\" and \"there is no access to attorneys, appeal procedures, or due process.\"\n\nAn American version of [Australia's shame in Nauru](\n\n>In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled that the Refugee Act of 1980, which bars the U.S. from forcibly returning refugees who feel threatened or persecuted in their home countries, did not apply outside the territory of the U.S. -- like at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nOkay, but transferring them to G Bay should be illegal right? Cause you'd be specifically circumventing the laws designed to avoid that? No? Power is as Power does.\n\n>The American Civil Liberties Union, along with IRAP, sued the government in 2024 for failing to disclose records about the interdiction and detention of refugees at the site.\n\n>It was also unclear whether Guantanamo Bay is the only military installation to be tapped for housing people slated for deportation.\n\nOh boy it's getting worse.\n\n>On Tuesday, CBS reported that Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado was being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, \"to stage and process\" undocumented migrants within the United States.\n\n>However, when Military.com reached out to U.S. Northern Command, a spokesperson said that Buckley \"is no longer identified as an installation support base\" and directed any other questions to ICE.\n\nNothing is true until officially denied, Trump will probably start it again.\n\n>The order to expand Guantanamo as a migrant detention facility is also far from the first issued by Trump that drew questions and silence from the Pentagon.\n\n>Late Monday evening, Trump fulfilled a promise and signed an executive order that he said would reinstate troops who were discharged over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate with back pay.\n\n>Neither the order nor Pentagon officials said what, if any, conditions would be applied to that promise or how to go about claiming it. Instead, a statement was issued saying the Pentagon \"will fully execute and implement all directives outlined in the executive orders issued by the president\" and \"provide status updates as we are able.\"\n\nTrump wants to have his cake and eat it too. He's responsible for WARP SPEED getting the vaccine, but you know, you don't have to take it, even if your ass belongs to the government. \n\n>That same night, Trump also moved to ban transgender people from serving in the military, but that order also left most of the details to the Pentagon and newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to figure out, including the top question of what will happen to trans troops who are already serving.\n\n>Again, the only reply from the Pentagon was attributed to a nameless defense official who said they \"will fully execute and implement all directives outlined in the executive orders issued by the president.\"\n\nWell if Trump crashes the economy, a huge unemployment spike will precede record-high enlistment rates.",

We’re just beginning to see what that means, [as he orders the construction of a migrant detention facility in Guantanamo Bay for 30,000 people](\n\nSeizing people off the streets requires an archipelago of detention camps while they await transport “home”. For how long, nobody knows. \n\nThe US naval base, where this facility will be, also includes the high-security military prison housing just 15 remnants of the “war on terror”, including the 9/11 mastermind, [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed](\n\nWhat began as a temporary holding pen on a US outpost in Cuba turned for nearly two decades into a terrible *oubliette*, housing hundreds of the supposed “worst of the worst” Al Qaeda terrorists.\n\nSome were; many weren’t. In 2003, I was one of the first journalists in the world to enter Camp Iguana, a tiny prison compound within the complex for three boys aged 13 to 15. These “juvenile enemy combatants” could watch Disney videos but could not see the sea. No prisoner could as they rotted away, deliberately far from justice and the law.\n\nMany islands in Latin America have served as penal colonies. Honduras is preparing the construction of the first new one in the West on an uninhabited nature reserve. Trump is not just thinking about Guantanamo. He admires the brutal treatment being meted out to tens of thousands of gang members in El Salvador. There, prisoners are being locked up in mass incarceration camps in horribly overcrowded cells and sleep on metal cots without mattresses. Some are serving 200-year sentences.\n\nDays before Trump spoke to Sir Keir Starmer by phone, the US leader rang [president Nayib Bukele last week]( to discuss “working together to stop illegal immigration and crack down on transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua”, according to a White House statement. As Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary, has confirmed, Trump views all undocumented immigrants as criminals because they entered the US illegally.\n\nMarco Rubio is about to head to El Salvador as part of a swing through Latin America on his first trip abroad as secretary of state. Top of his agenda will be a so-called “safe third party” agreement for Bukele to take non-Salvadorian detainees.",

          "Plain text copy below:\n\n**Trump appointee fires January 6 prosecutors and issues threat to FBI agents**\n\n**About two dozen Justice Department employees involved in Capitol riot cases sacked and demand issued for list of FBI officers**\n\n**Guardian staff and agencies**\n\n**Sat 1 Feb 2025 03.41 EST**\n\n\nThe Trump administration has fired a group of Justice Department prosecutors involved in the 6 January criminal cases and demanded the names of FBI agents involved in those same investigations so they can possibly be ousted.\n\nThe jobs of about 24 employees at the US attorney’s office in Washington were terminated late on Friday, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel issues.\n\nThe acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, a Trump appointee, ordered the firings, according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press; and in a separate, earlier memo identified more than half a dozen FBI senior executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by Monday.\n\nBove also on Friday asked for the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on investigations into the 6 January 2021 US Capitol riot – a list the bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands.\n\nIt comes after Trump’s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged and/or convicted in the US Capitol attack.\n\nBove, who has defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Department of Justice officials would then carry out a “review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary”.\n\n“As we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy and do what’s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people – always,” the acting FBI director, Brian Driscoll, wrote in a letter to the workforce.\n\nThe prosecutors fired in the DC US attorney’s office had been hired for temporary assignments to support the January 6 cases, but were moved into permanent roles after Trump’s presidential win in November, according to the memo obtained by the Associated Press. Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, said he would not “tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration”.\n\nAny mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the justice department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump.\n\nThe FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented “outrageous actions by acting officials” that were “fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI agents”.\n\n“Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure,” the association said in a statement.\n\nWhen pressed during his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees.\n\nAsked by the Democratic senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that didn’t follow that standard process, Patel said: “I don’t know what’s going on right now over there, but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.”\n\nBefore he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called anti-Trump “conspirators” in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out.\n\n\nTrump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and the justice department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the past four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks after his win in November.\n\nAsked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: “No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen before. They came after a lot of people – like me – but they came after a lot of people.”\n\nHe added: “If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing, because they were very bad.”\n\nThe FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nThe Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them – including the ones convicted of violent crimes – through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments.\n\nThis week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives – including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge of big-city field offices – have been told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday.\n\nWith Associated Press",
          ">The eight executives have been forced out but Driscoll did not say in the memo whether he would turn over the broader list of Jan. 6-related names — a list that he noted encompasses thousands of FBI employees, including him. \n\n\nTrump is literally asking them to gut the entire agency in the span of a day",

          "This afternoon, FBI personnel braced for a retaliatory purge of the nation’s premiere law-enforcement agency, as President Donald Trump appeared ready to fire potentially hundreds of agents and officials who’d participated in investigations that led to criminal charges against him.\n\nA team that investigated Trump’s mishandling of classified documents was expected to be fired, four people familiar with the matter said. \n\nTrump has long fumed about that investigation, which involved a raid on his Mar-a-Lago estate that turned up hundreds of classified documents he had taken after he left the White House four years ago.\n\nDavid Sundberg, the head of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, is also being fired, these people added. Sundberg is a career FBI agent with more than two decades of experience, and he oversees some of the bureau’s most sensitive cases related to national security and counterintelligence. \n\nCurrent and former officials told me they are worried that those investigations could stall, at least temporarily, if a large number of agents are suddenly removed. A spokesperson at the Washington Field Office declined to comment.\n\nTrump’s retribution is not limited to those who investigated him personally. Administration officials are reviewing records to identify FBI personnel who participated in investigations of the January 6 assault on the Capitol by his supporters, people familiar with the matter told me.\n\nThat could potentially involve hundreds if not thousands of agents, including those who interviewed and investigated rioters who were later prosecuted. Shortly after taking office, Trump pardoned about 1,500 of the rioters and commuted others’ sentences.\n\nThere is no precedent for the mass termination of FBI personnel in this fashion. Current and former officials I spoke with had expected Trump to exact retribution for what he sees as unjust and even illegal efforts by the FBI and the Justice Department to investigate his conduct.\n\n⏬ Bluesky 'bite-sized' article thread (5 min) with extra links 📖 🍿 🔊\n\n[\n\n[archive.is/FWIO0](",
